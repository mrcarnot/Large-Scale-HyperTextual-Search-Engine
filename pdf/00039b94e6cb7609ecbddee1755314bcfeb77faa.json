Plasma were separated by centrifugation (2000 g for 10 min) at 4 \u221e C and stored in 300 m l aliquots at -70 \u221e C until analysis. Because the more commonly used procedure of enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) may generate infectious droplets and aerosols, T helper (Th)1/Th2 cytokines, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in plasma were measured serially by cytometric bead array (CBA) using a four-colour FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, CA, USA) located in a Biosafety Level II laboratory [20, 21] . In CBA, five or six bead populations with distinct fluorescence intensities had been coated with capturing antibodies specific for different cytokines or chemokines. These bead populations could be resolved in the fluorescence channels of the flow cytometer. After the beads had been incubated with 50 m l of plasma, different cytokines or chemokines in the sample were captured by their corresponding beads.

The progression of this potentially lethal disease may be represented by three phases: acute viral multiplication, hyperactive immune response, recovery or pulmonary destruction and death [1, 4, 5] . Accordingly, it is worthwhile to investigate cytokine and chemokine induction, which may be the cause or consequence of immune hyperactivity in SARS. We observed that for at least 2 weeks after disease onset, all SARS patients exhibited a significant increase in the typical antiviral Th1 cytokine IFN-g and an array of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 b , IL-6 and IL-12), together with a moderate increase in anti-inflammatory IL-10 that was manifested in some patients. IL-1 b can act as the early response cytokine to viral infection such as that caused by the human immunodeficiency virus, for mediation of inflammatory response, synthesis of acute phase proteins and release of IL-8 [14, 22] . IL-6 may play a proinflammatory role in pulmonary inflammation [23] . Th2 cytokine IL-10 is an antiinflammatory cytokine that suppresses the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines [24] , therefore it was elevated in some patients 1 week after disease onset and followed the elevation of other inflammatory cytokines. IL-12, also known as natural killer (NK) cell stimulatory factor or cytotoxic lymphocyte maturation factor, is a pleiotropic proinflammatory cytokine which is produced primarily by antigen-presenting cells (monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and B cells) and PMN [25] . IL-12 can induce the production of IFN-g and other Th1 cytokines with suppression of the Th2 pathway [26, 27] . It has multiple effects on T lymphocytes and NK cells, including the ability to stimulate cytotoxicity, proliferation, cytokine production and the development of Th1 subsets [28, 29] . Therefore, the observed early elevation of inflammatory cytokines IL-1 b , IL-6, IL-12 and IFN-g could be causative of the SARS-CoV-induced activation of Th1 cells and NK cells, release of chemokines such as IL-8, and results in pulmonary inflammation [16] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 325, "end": 328, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 329, "end": 331, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 332, "end": 334, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1025, "end": 1029, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1030, "end": 1033, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1099, "end": 1103, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1216, "end": 1220, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1621, "end": 1625, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1729, "end": 1733, "text": "[26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1734, "end": 1737, "text": "27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1914, "end": 1918, "text": "[28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1919, "end": 1922, "text": "29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2177, "end": 2181, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "A previous study has suggested that the infiltration of proinflammatory PMN is involved in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury [30] .

IL-8, the PMN achemokine, has been shown to be elevated in blood and alveolar spaces [34] and exhibit a positive correlation with the number of PMN in BAL fluid of patients with pneumonia and ARDS [35] . Our SARS-CoV-infected patients also showed elevation of plasma IL-8 soon after disease onset, which declined from 5 to 8 days after corticosteroid treatment. In our former clinical study, 82% of 157 SARS patients developed neutrophilia and the high neutrophil counts were associated with ICU admission and mortality from pneumonia [4] .

MCP-1 concentration has been shown to increase in BAL fluid of patients with persistent ARDS [36] , correlating positively with the predominance of alveolar macrophages [37] that has also been found in the postmortem examination of SARS patients [2, 38] . IP-10 is a specific chemoattractant for Th1 cells for the activation of cell-mediated immune response; its expression can be up-regulated by the Th1 cytokine IFN-g in acute lung inflammation [39] . Consistently, our results showed that both circulating IFN-g and IP-10 were increased in SARS patients. Our observation of low or normal Th2 cytokine IL-4 in SARS patients is also similar to the finding of a previous study of viral pneumonia [40] . These suggest that SARS-CoV does not enhance the Th2 pathway and the subsequent humoral immue response. Such imbalance of Th1/Th2 cytokine profile confirms the SARS-CoVinduced Th1 predominance. In contrast to H5N1 infection [15] , plasma TNF-a was not elevated in our patients. This finding, therefore, does not support the therapeutic use of TNF-a monoclonal antibody for SARS. However, it must be cautioned that the concentration of TNF-a at the pulmonary inflammatory sites has not been investigated. Previous studies have implicated that inflammatory IL-b and the acute-phase cytokine IL-6 are endogenous pyrogens or inducers of fever [41] . Therefore, elevations of IL-b and IL-6 might account for the fever onset, as both of them were found to have high plasma concentrations during the first week of disease. Moreover, the T cell chemokines MIG and RANTES also did not show any significantly elevation.

This leads to the recruitment and accumulation of alveolar macrophages and PMN [42] , as well as the activation of Th1 cell-mediated immunity by the stimulation of NK and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Treatment with immunosuppressive corticosteroid can significantly suppress the elevated chemokines IL-8, IP-10 and MCP-1, and subsequently alleviate the chemokine-associated pulmonary inflammation in SARS. Indeed, the reduction in IL-8, IP-10 and MCP-1 correlated with the improvement in general clinical condition, pulmonary function and radiological appearance in SARS patients of our present study. In addition, we also observed that higher disease severity was associated with more elevated plasma IFN-g, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, IP-10 and MCP-1 concentrations (Fig. 3) . It can be postulated that the addition of pulsed steroid in the severe-disease group not only controlled the rapidly deteriorating clinical condition, but basically attenuated the otherwise over-exaggerated immunological response with potentially much high median concentrations of plasma cytokines and chemokines. This further supports that the above cytokines and chemokines played impor-tant roles in the immunopathological mechanisms of SARS. We have initiated a study comparing plasma cytokines and chemokines in SARS patients with and without corticosteroid treatment. The elevated plasma cytokines and chemokines should also shed light on the possibility of using them as prognostic indicators for disease severity in SARS.
