These cells belong mainly to the monocyte/macrophage lineage. How these cells survive in immune cats is not known. In this study, FIPV positive cells were isolated from pyogranulomas and exudates of 12 naturally FIPV-infected cats and the presence of two immunologic targets, viral antigens and MHC I, on their surface was determined. The majority of the infected cells were confirmed to be cells from the monocyte/macrophage lineage. No surface expression of viral antigens was detected on FIPV positive cells. MHC I molecules were present on all the FIPV positive cells. After cultivation of the isolated infected cells, 52 AE 10% of the infected cells re-expressed viral antigens on the plasma membrane. In conclusion, it can be stated that in FIP cats, FIPV replicates in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage without carrying viral antigens in their plasma membrane, which could allow them to escape from antibody-dependent cell lysis. #	Introduction: Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal chronic disease in cats caused by a coronavirus, feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), and characterized by granulomatous lesions formed at the serosae of different organs. Two forms can be distinguished. Cats suffering from the wet or effusive form have exudates in their body cavities. Exudate is absent in the second form, hence the name dry or non-effusive form. FIPV-infected cells are detected in the pyogranulomas and, based on morphology and the granulocyte/ monocyte/macrophage marker calprotectin, defined as macrophages (Weiss and Scott, 1981; Kipar et al., 1998) . Infected mononuclear cells were also isolated from exudates (Cammarata Parodi et al., 1993; Paltrinieri et al., 1999) . In one way or another, these infected cells succeed in staying alive and transmitting www.elsevier.com/locate/vetmic Veterinary Microbiology 121 (2007) [131] [132] [133] [134] [135] [136] [137] virus to new susceptible cells in the presence of a high concentration of antibodies. How they do this, is not known. Infected cells are normally eliminated by the adaptive immune system through antibody-mediated lysis or cell-mediated lysis. For the antibody-mediated lysis, the presence of antigens on the surface of infected cells is important for the recognition of these cells by antibodies and the subsequent destruction by the immune system (Sissons and Oldstone, 1980) . For pseudorabies virus (PRV) end equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1), it has been described that absence of antigens on the surface membrane of infected monocytes, due to antibody-induced internalization or lacking of expression, respectively, protects the infected cells from efficient complement-mediated lysis (van der Meulen et al., 2003 (van der Meulen et al., , 2006 Van de Walle et al., 2003) . In in vitro studies with FIPV 79-1146-infected feline monocytes, it was shown that viral antigens are expressed in the plasma membrane in 50% of the infected cells. In these cells, the surface expressed viral antigens are internalized after addition of antibodies, leaving the plasma membrane of the cell cleared from all visually detectable viral antigens (Dewerchin et al., 2005 (Dewerchin et al., , 2006 . Besides through antibody-mediated lysis, the adaptive immune system can eliminate virus-infected cells through cell-mediated immunity. Some of the newly synthesized viral proteins in infected cells are disintegrated by proteasomes, the peptides are coupled to major histocompatibility complex I (MHC I) and transported to the plasma membrane of the infected cell. This complex is recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes which kill the infected cell. Viruses have developed various ingenious ways to block the MHC I antigen presentation pathway (Hewitt, 2003) . For pseudorabies virus (PRV), it has been described that during antibody-induced internalization of viral glycoproteins in infected blood monocytes, the MHC I molecules are co-internalized . Absence of MHC I molecules allows PRV-infected cells to hide from the cell-mediated immunity (Favoreel, 1999) . Up till now, it is not known if FIPV affects the MHC I expression on the surface of FIPV-infected cells in FIP cats. In the present study, it was examined in infected monocytes/macrophages of FIP cats if viral antigens are expressed on the plasma membrane and if the expression of MHC I molecules was inhibited. | Cats with naturally occurring FIP: Twelve cats strongly suspected of FIP by clinicians (based on cat profile, clinical signs and blood and/or exudate examination) were used in this study. The sex, age, breed, FCoV antibody titre and type of FIP (effusive or non-effusive) are listed in Table 1 . | Antibodies: Monospecific, polyclonal antibodies originating from cats infected with serotype II FIPV 79-1146 were kindly provided by Dr. Egberinck (Utrecht University, The Netherlands). Polyclonal antibodies against FIPV serotype I were isolated from a cat infected with a serotype I strain. Immunoblotting showed strong reaction with the spike protein of the serotype I strain Black. Both polyclonal antibodies against serotypes I and II were purified and biotinylated according to manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Bioscience, Buckinghamshire, UK). A mixture of both biotinylated antibodies was used in the immunofluorescent stainings (biotinylated anti-FIPV Ab). It was confirmed that the mixture of biotinylated antibodies was able to stain surface expression of both serotype I as serotype II viruses. Feline polyclonal fluorescein-conjugated antibodies detecting both serotypes I and II (anti-FIPV-FITC Ab), a major histocompatibility complex I (MHC I) marker (CF298A) and a monocyte-macrophagegranulocyte marker (DH59B) were purchased from Veterinary Medical Research and Development (VMRD) (Pullman, Washington, USA). | Isolation of FIPV positive cells: Cats were euthanized using 1 ml/1.5 kg Na-pentobarbital (Kela, Hoogstraten, Belgium) and exudates were collected and diluted 1:1 with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 15 U/ml heparin (Leo, Zaventem, Belgium). Cells present in the exudate were collected by centrifugation at 400 Â g for 10 min at 4 8C. Afterwards, tissues with pyogranulomas were collected. Small blocks containing almost just the pyogranulomas were immediately placed in RPMI-1640 at 37 8C (Gibco BRL, Merelbeke, Belgium). For isolation of individual cells the small blocks were mechanically separated using two needles. The cell suspension was then centrifuged at 400 Â g for 10 min at 4 8C. | Characterization of FIPV positive cells: The obtained cell suspensions from the exudates and the tissues with pyogranulomas were each divided in three parts on which different stainings in suspension were performed. The cells from the pyogranulomas and the exudate of cat 2 were stained together. The first staining was performed to determine the viability and the monocyte/macrophage nature of the FIPV positive cells. Since the marker DH59B also detects granulocytes, besides macrophages and monocytes, the morphology of the nucleus was taken into account to determine whether the cells belonged to the monocyte/macrophage lineage. The second staining was performed to detect if viral antigens were present on the surface of FIPV positive cells. The third staining was performed to determine the presence of MHC I on the surface of FIPV positive cells and the effect on the viability of the cells. The latter staining was only performed for cats 6, 7, 8 and 9. The different staining steps and used antibodies and conjugates are given in Table 2 . After staining, cells were mounted on microscope slides using glycerin-PBS solution (0.9/0.1, v/v) with 2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo(2,2,2)octane (Janssen Chimica, Beerse, Belgium) and analyzed by a Leica DM RBE fluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). | Cultivation of FIPV positive cells: The isolated cells from cats 10, 11 and 12 were cultured in a 24-well plate on a glass coverslip for 0, 2, 4 and 6 h. At each time point, the immunofluorescence staining for detection of surface expressed viral antigens was performed (staining 2). After staining, the glass coverslips were mounted on microscope slides and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. | Statistics: Results were analyzed with the Wilcoxon signed ranks test. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 11.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). | Results: FIPV positive cells were found in cell suspensions from exudates and pyogranulomas in all cats. The percentage of FIPV positive cells varied from <1 to 10% (Table 3 ). The majority of the FIPV positive cells (95 AE 5%) belonged to the monocyte/macrophage lineage (mononuclear and DH59B positive) (Fig. 1 , lane A). Less than 1% of the FIPV positive cells showed a polymorphonuclear nucleus. Staining 2 revealed that no infected cells showed expression of viral antigens on their surface (Fig. 1, lane B) . After cultivation of the FIPV positive cells, viral antigens were re-expressed on the plasma membrane as soon as 2 h post-seeding. Re-expression only occurred in 52 AE 10% of infected cells (Fig. 2) . The results of the MHC I staining (staining 3) in isolated cells of cats 6, 7, 8 and 9 showed that MHC I expression was present on 98 AE 3% of the FIPV positive cells (Fig. 1, of MHC I expression was observed between live and dead cells. | lane C). No difference in amount: The results of the viability staining (staining 1) are given in Table 3 . This staining showed that the percentage of dead FIPV positive monocytes in pyogranulomas was significantly higher than the control cells (FIPV negative, DH95B positive cells) ( p < 0.1), whereas no difference was observed in exudates between FIPV positive monocytes and the control cells. | Discussion: In this study, it was shown that FIPV positive monocytes in cats with FIP express MHC I on their surface, but not viral antigens. The presence of viral antigens on the cell surface of infected cells is important for the recognition and elimination of infected cells by the immune system. Binding of virus-specific antibodies to viral proteins present on the surface, makes infected cells recognizable for the classical complement pathway, phagocytes and natural killer cells, which will lead to lysis of infected cells (Harper, 1994) . In this study, viral antigens were not detected on the surface of FIPV positive cells isolated from nine cats with FIP. This could implicate that the FIPV positive cells may remain ''invisible'' for the humoral immune system and continue the production of progeny virus without being eliminated. It is not known which mechanism lies behind the absence of surface expressed viral antigens. The results of the cultivation experiment demonstrated that about half of the infected cells are not capable of expressing viral antigens on their surface. This observation is consistent with the in vitro findings of Dewerchin et al. (2005) . They showed that 50% of FIPV 79-1146 infected monocytes do not express viral antigens on the plasma membrane. The absence of viral antigens on the surface of FIPV positive cells isolated from FIP cats that seem to be capable of expressing viral antigens, can be due to the fact that virus-specific antibodies bind to the antigens and as a consequence the viral antigens are internalized. Another possibility is antibody-induced capping of viral antigens and extrusion from the cell. Since the antibody-induced internalization has been described in in vitro infected monocytes that do show surface expressed viral antigens, it most likely occurs also in vivo (Dewerchin et al., 2006) . The fact that viral antigens could not be demonstrated with the used staining is not the result of antibodies present in the cat that already bound to these antigens and hinder binding of other antibodies. This hindering is not likely to occur since in FIPVinfected Crandell feline kidney cells, surface expressed FIPV antigens covered by strain specific antibodies were still accessible for other antibodies (data not shown). Besides antibody-mediated elimination of virusinfected cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are also capable of killing infected cells. During an infection, viral peptides are loaded on MHC I molecules and transported to the plasma membrane. This complex may be recognized by CTLs which leads to killing of the infected cell. In this study, the presence of MHC I on FIPV positive cells was analyzed. On all FIPV positive cells MHC I was present, showing that no internalization or retention of the MHC I molecules occurs. However, with the used techniques, it was not possible to quantify the number of MHC I molecules and to determine whether the MHC I molecules were loaded with FIPV peptides. With the exception of two cats, higher cell death in infected cells seems to be present in pyogranulomas. In exudates, this observation was not made. The cause of this difference between pyogranulomas and exudates is not clear. The increased cell death may be due to infection or to the response of the immune system on the infected cell. Since no viral antigens are present on the plasma membrane, it can be stated that antibody-mediated lysis is inhibited. The expression of MHC I is not inhibited in infected cells, indicating that the cellular immunity may still be able to lyse the infected cell, if viral peptides are presented. It is generally accepted that a strong cellular immunity enables the cat to overcome infection (Pedersen and Black, 1983; Hayashi et al., 1982; Weiss and Cox, 1989) . However, it has also been postulated that, during a chronic FIPV infection, the cell-mediated lysis is inhibited due to apoptosis and T-cell depletion caused by soluble mediators released during infection (Haagmans et al., 1996; de Groot-Mijnes et al., 2005) . Taking into account all these observations, it becomes clear that the outcome of a FIPV infection is a complicated interaction of the immune system and the virus. One thing is sure, the humoral immune response is not able to protect the cat against progression of viral replication and consequently of disease. The precise role of the cellular immune response in protection needs to be further investigated. In conclusion, it can be stated that cytoplasmic FIPV-infected cells do not show surface expressed viral antigens in vivo which may make them invisible for the humoral immune response. In contrast, MHC I molecules are abundantly present on their surface.	E Cornelissen; H L Dewerchin; E Van Hamme; H J Nauwynck	1993	0001418189999fea7f7cbe3e82703d71c85a6fe5	pdf
0003793cf9e709bc2b9d0c8111186f78fb73fc04	Title: Rethinking high-risk groups in COVID-19	Body: How do we protect our 'high-risk' patient populations? This was the dominant focus of our coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) neurology departmental meeting at the start of the epidemic weeks ago, where a neurologist in his late 50s assured us we were at minimal danger from coronavirus, and our efforts should focus on protecting our high-risk patients. But do we know exactly who these 'high-risk' people are? Although there was limited data to guide them, our hospital, the CDC, 1 and various medical associations repeated the intuitive refrain that 'high risk' patients are the 'immunocompromised and elderly.' A hospital-wide high-risk patient working group was established early on, consisting of neuroimmunologists and other physicians across disciplines that care for immunocompromised individuals. Specific guidance for immunocompromised patients regarding COVID-19 was pushed out quickly. Appointments for immunocompromised patients were converted to virtual visits or deferred if possible, before appointments for other patients. The inclusion of immunocompromised patients in the 'high-risk population' for COVID-19 is intuitive-immunosuppression should make a person more likely to contract an infection and may prolong the disease course. However, the data thus far has not borne this out. Early analyses of large Chinese cohorts have identified risk factors such as older age, hypertension, chronic respiratory diseases, and cardiovascular diseases, but not immunosuppression, as risk factors for disease severity in COVID-19. 2 In addition, data on prior related coronavirus outbreaks in MERS 3 and SARS 4 did not show any evidence of increased risk of infection or morbidity in immunocompromised populations. With the current outbreak, reports of 2 heart transplant recipients 5 and the first renal transplant recipient 6 with COVID-19 infection showed a clinical course, recovery, and laboratory profile similar to that of immunocompetent patients. A pediatric liver transplant center in Italy reported no significant pulmonary disease from COVID-19 amongst their patients with autoimmune liver disease, on chemotherapy, or those who were post-transplant. 7 An analysis from China did note increased rates of infection and morbidity in cancer patients, 8 however, it did not adjust for age, included patients many years out from their cancer treatments, and has been the subject of several responses that contest the conclusion of increased risk to cancer patients. 9,10 Indeed, one response raised the point that decreased access to quality medical care, rather than the virus itself, is the primary danger facing cancer patients in the current pandemic. 10 No data exists regarding other transplant, rheumatologic or neuroimmunological conditions, which itself prompts the question of whether these patients are indeed at higher risk than the general population. Not only has evidence that immunosuppression causes increased risk in COVID-19 been lacking, there is also a theoretical argument that immunosuppression may be therapeutic. A hyperinflammatory response to COVID-19 may cause a cytokine storm syndrome, driving severe and deadly cases of COVID-19. 11 Clinical investigations into the utility of various immunosuppressive agents in COVID-19, including tocilizumab (an IL-6 inhibitor), Janus kinus (JAK) inhibitors, and others are ongoing. 12 Instead of focusing on immunosuppression, we need to re-consider who qualifies as an 'elderly' person in regards to COVID-19 risk. Advanced older age as a risk factor for COVID-19 infection and death has been well substantiated. Over 1 out of 5 patients in Italy over the age of 80 succumbed to the disease, 13 and according to the CDC, 31-70% of confirmed COVID-19 patients over the age of 85 in the United States require hospitalization. 1 Lay press articles paint the at risk elderly as 'our grandparents,' 'nursing home residents,' or 'retirees.' And yet, while the very elderly in their 80s are most severely affected by the disease, the median age of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 in a large retrospective study in China was only 52 years. 14 The case fatality rate for individuals in the 60-69 age group was an unreassuring 3.5% in Italy and 3.6% in China, and hospitalizations in this age group are extremely common. 13 Morbidity may peak in society's oldest members, but anyone older than 50 is far from safe, and many in this group represent our health care workers, grocery store employees, government leaders, caregivers, and other members of society serving essential functions in the midst of this crisis. Unlike immunocompromised individuals, average adults in their 50s or 60s may never have thought of themselves as vulnerable; thus, messaging about their elevated risk should be targeted and unambiguous. The data regarding risk factors for poor outcomes in COVID-19 is far from definitive-as we learn more about this disease, we may find that certain cancers, neuroimmunologic conditions, or immunosuppressive agents do indeed increase morbidity. The medical complexity of some immunocompromised patients may itself lead to higher risk for nosocomial infections or complications related to hospitalization. Those in their 80s and 90s are at the highest risk from this infection, and we must do everything we can to protect them. However, as health professionals focus on 'immunocompromised and elderly' patients in our public health messaging, we send an implicit message, that others have made explicit, that those outside of these groups are safer. Paradoxically, the physician in his late 50s speaking about protecting high-risk immunocompromised patients at our hospital meeting, may himself be at higher risk than many of the immunocompromised patients he seeks to protect. These issues are consequential-some multiple sclerosis patients are considering delays in their immunosuppressive regimens due to the pandemic, older healthcare workers are coming out of retirement to work on the frontlines, and there is ongoing debate in government about the who will be at risk when we reopen society. It is time to urgently begin the discussion within the medical community on how to target accurate messaging to those at highest risk.

Introduction: Integration of functional electronic devices on rigid surfaces can enable smart structures with sophisticated functionalities and applications [1] [2] [3] [4] such as bio-integrated electronics in healthcare systems, dynamic structural health monitoring in aerospace applications and miniature radar devices for defense applications [1] [2] [3] [4] . A critical enabler of these applications is the fabrication of electrically conductive 3D interconnects conformally on to 3D surfaces [2, 4, 5] . These interconnects can be combined with pick-and-place methods for integrating other active devices. Past work has shown several methods that can fabricate such conformal interconnects. In transfer printing, the ability to conform to complex surface features is limited to smooth curved surfaces due to the inherent need for a mechanical handling system to transfer the interconnects embedded on planar elastomer to the target 3D surface [3, 6] . Conformal 3D printing of nanospheres directly on the target surface can fabricate conformal circuits without requiring mechanical conformation, with high geometric versatility and without expensive vacuum deposition [4] . Further, it has significant advantages over laser direct structuring that is often used to fabricate molded-interconnect-devices because expensive metallic inorganic compounds for the entire mold and the chemical plating processes are eliminated. At the same time conformal 3D printing needs heating of the 3D object and the conformally printed circuits to reduce electrical resistance. This is carried out in an oven at high temperatures (≈ 200-550 °C), for a longer time (≈ 1-2 hours). The use of ovens limits the usable size and material of the 3D object. Laser sintering of the printed interconnects alleviates direct heating of the bulk of the 3D object but can still cause significant indirect heating of the 3D surface, which limits the choice of materials for the 3D object. Wire embedding process involves embedding the interconnect on the polymer using a localized thermal source. This method is applicable to thermoplastic materials which constrains the object material window [7, 8] . In lamination forming process conformal circuits are fabricated by depositing the interconnects on a planar polymer substrate, and then forming the assembly to the shape of the desired freeform surface [9] . This approach enables better conformance to sharp surface features, wider material window due to lack of heating of the 3D object, as well as potentially larger and more modular circuits.

However, the commercially available 48th SME North American Manufacturing Research Conference, NAMRC 48 (Cancelled due to polymer-metal inks can be printed on to polymer sheets and then thermoformed result in very high resistivity of ≈ 500-1000 µΩ-cm even after post sintering due to the high polymer content of these inks [9] . We investigate sequential vacuum-forming [10] [11] [12] and Flash Light Sintering (FLS) [13, 14] of printed nanomaterial-based interconnects on planar polymer sheets [15] to overcome the high resistivity issue with the lamination-based process. The advantages of this Form-Fuse process are as follows: (i) high throughput, (ii) causes minimal substrate damage and thus enables wider material window, (iii) enhanced repairability (iv) robust integration with the target 3D object and (v) high scalability [15] . Hereafter, the term nanoparticle collectively refers to nanowires (NWs), nanospheres (NSs) and nanoflakes (NFs). Silver (Ag) inks with nanomaterials mixed in different ratios were printed on a polycarbonate (PC) sheet to fabricate planar interconnects [ Fig. 1(a) ]. This planar assembly was vacuum-formed into the desired surface geometry [ Fig. 1(b) ] and then subjected to FLS [ Fig. 1(c) ]. The dependence of interconnect resistance and shape on the forming strain, FLS fluence, and nanomaterial shape are examined. In particular, variation in nanomaterial shape is affected by mixing NWs, NSs & NFs in different concentrations. The process capability is further demonstrated via a simple conformal LED-lighting circuit for relatively complex 3D surfaces. | Methods: Ag NWs (150 µm length, 100 nm diameter, ACS Materials), Ag NSs (20 nm diameter, US-Nano) and Ag NFs (100 nm size, Inframat) were individually suspended in ethanol at 5 mg/mL concentration without any dispersant to prepare a stable ink. In this study, pure Ag NW ink was mixed with pure Ag NS ink at 5%, 15%, and 25% concentrations by weight to obtain mixed NW-NS inks. NW-NF inks were also prepared in a similar method with the aforementioned concentrations. Wide-area Aerosol-Jet Printing (AJP) with a mask was used to deposit the mixed inks on a 250 µm thick PC sheets, as shown in Fig. 1(a) . Printing nanomaterials of this concentration and size has also been performed by largearea printheads without a mask [16] . During printing, the sample stage was preheated to 70⁰C to quickly evaporate the ethanol. For process characterization, the printed pattern was a straight-line interconnect. The in-plane stage motion was controlled by G-codes. After depositing the interconnect pattern, the printed substrate was taken out of the AJP stage and the mask was removed from the substrate [ Fig. 1(d) ]. The number of printing passes was maintained at 140 in order to retain similar interconnect thickness across different samples. The interconnect-PC assembly was then thermoformed to the given mold shape by heating it above the polymer's glass-transition temperature (Tg). The Tg for PC was measured using Differential Scanning Calorimetry to be 153 ℃. The mold was designed with air suction ducts and fabricated with polyetherimide using stereolithography based 3D printing. Mold with a truncated pyramid cross-section and aspect ratio (width/height) of 2.5, characterized by a maximum mold angle θm = 60⁰ [ Fig. 1 (c] was used to characterize the effect of nanomaterial compositions on post-forming resistance. The PC-interconnect assembly was aligned such that one end of the interconnect is on the top section and the other end is located at the root section of the mold. This setup was adapted so that uniaxial strain was imposed on the interconnect along the pyramid slope. During our experiments, the mold was completely raised so that the polymer substrate (PC) was made to wrap the mold. The fixed PC was heated to 200℃ (as measured by a thermal camera), and then vacuum-formed to the mold shape. The vacuum-forming process took about 30 seconds to complete. This vacuum-formed assembly was subjected to FLS (Sinteron 3000 system, Xenon Corporation). This lamp has a minimum optical footprint, and therefore working area, of 1-foot x 1 inch. The thermal power density Q absorbed at an arbitrary location on the 3D interconnect was obtained as shown in Eq. (1). In this equation Q depends on distance D; the fraction of total optical irradiance at given wavelength λ, i.e. X(λ); ratio of absorbed power Pa (λ) to incident power Pi (λ) on the interconnect; and the lamp voltage V in kV. The term (V/3120) 2.4 denotes the total optical irradiance at a given voltage at the focal plane, as specified by the manufacturer. The base of the formed PC was fixed at 0.5 inches away from the lamp focal plane, and the lamp voltage was fixed at 3 kV. The focal plane of the light is located at 1 inch from the lamp casing. The optical fluence at the PC base was varied, as 5,7 & 9 J/cm 2 , with single optical pulse. The interconnect resistance was quantified by attaching copper tapes with highly conductive silver paste to the end-pads of the interconnects. The interconnect morphology was analyzed via Scanning Electron Micrography (SEM, Zeiss Sigma Field Emission 8100). The optical absorption of the deposited Ag NWs was measured using an UV-vis spectrophotometer. The sintering temperature was measured with an optical pyrometer. Post-FLS resistance decreases with increase in optical fluence for all configurations. At higher fluence (9J/cm 2 ) blowoff is visually observed in pure Ag NW cases as in past work [17, 18] . The blowoff occurs due to nanoscale degradation and evaporation of NWs beyond a limiting fluence [15] . The missing data points in Figures 2c and 2f denote that there is no conductivity across the interconnect to measure resistance. However, for samples mixed with higher NS or NF content are less prone to FLS induced damage. Figs. 3(a) -(d) show SEM images after forming and after FLS. Clustering of NFs or NSs at NW-NW junctions is observable. The size of the aggregate formation is bigger at higher concentrations for both NFs and NSs. These clusters were observed across the interconnect after deposition and are caused due to the presence of surface defects on the nanoflakes & nanospheres [19] . Lower number of contact points and higher neck growth is desirable for better percolation of electrons [20, 21] . Figure 2 shows that the change in line resistance between post-forming and post-FLS is much greater in mixed configurations and further increases with an increase in NF or NS content than pure NW samples. Also, interconnects containing NW-NS or NW-NF mixtures sustain higher optical fluence energy than pure NWs. | AFTER FORMING AFTER FLS: (400 to 700 nm). It is observed that the NW-NF configuration samples have greater optical absorption than other samples. Pure NWs showed very low optical absorption characteristics. This is because NFs have greater optical absorption than NWs [22, 23] . Therefore NW-NF ensemble results in greater optical absorption characteristics than only NWs. This phenomenon is applicable to NW-NS mixtures as well. Sintering temperatures were measured at the root section of the formed samples for 5J/cm 2 optical fluence [ Fig. 4(b) ]. The 25% NF sample had the highest sintering temperature at 237.5 ⁰C and pure NWs sample had the lowest sintering temperature at 193.2 ⁰C. Figure 4 (b) shows that sintering temperatures increase with greater non-NW content for both NW-NF and NW-NS configurations. Hence it is safe to assume that the incident optical energy from the flash lamp is effectively absorbed by the NSs or NFs. The heat generated due to optical absorption is transferred to NW-NW junctions to facilitate interparticle neck growth thus resulting in a greater change in post-FLS line resistance for NW-NS or NW-NF samples as shown in Figure 2 . Thus, nanomaterial shape plays a key role in reducing the line resistance after FLS so that neck growth induced reduction in resistance due to FLS can overcome the concurrent increase in resistance due to vacuum-forming. The lowest post-FLS resistance here (≈ 10 Ω/cm, resistivity of 55.4 µΩ-cm) is achieved in pure Ag NW samples sintered at 5J/cm 2 optical energy [ Fig 5(a) ], which is considered as the optimal fluence in this work. In order to achieve lower manufacturing costs, interconnects containing NW-NS mixtures and sintered at higher fluence can be used to achieve resistance, similar to that of pure NWs sample. But if the optical fluence or the NS content is greater than a certain optimum, the resistance will increase due to blowoff. Thus, FLS plays a key role in compensating for the increase in resistance after vacuum-forming. The change in resistivity with respect to forming angle is plotted in Figure 4 (c). It is observed that change in resistivities post-forming & post-FLS are comparable at lower forming angles (30⁰ & 40⁰). At higher forming angles (50⁰ & 60⁰), the change in resistivity is non-linear. This is due to greater strain on the NWs as the forming angle increases. Our process with optimal parameters was used to integrate conductive interconnects on more complex surfaces such as the stepped geometry [ Fig. 5a ] and the concavo-convex geometry [Fig 5b] . The PCinterconnect assemblies were adhesively integrated with the mold surface and connected to an LED-photoresistor circuit. | Conclusion: This paper discusses the influence of nanomaterial shape morphology on line resistance in the Form-Fuse process. Addition of NSs or NFs in NWs expand the useable fluence range by alleviating blowoff but at the cost of lower conductivity. The non-linear dependence of line-resistance on the addition of NSs or NFs was explained using SEM characterization, UV-Vis spectroscopy and temperature measurements. UV-Vis and temperature measurements show that addition of NFs or NSs results in greater optical absorption due to size and shape effects. This leads to greater NW-NW neck growth and resulted in observed post-FLS resistance decrease. Note that the scale of this Form-Fuse process can be increased by using large area printheads along with commercial vacuum-forming machines and linearly placed sintering lamps. The demonstrated process also enables high throughput and circuit repairability and wide material window, which makes this process versatile and independent of object size and shape. However, there are several unanswered questions such as: why is there a significant change in line resistance from post-forming to post-FLS for samples containing NFs or NSs when compared to NWs only cases? Does localized optical absorption or sintering kinetics or both drive this change? The reasoning behind these questions will be discussed in our future work.

00039b94e6cb7609ecbddee1755314bcfeb77faa	Plasma inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in severe acute respiratory syndrome	Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a recently emerged infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, but its immunopathological mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. We investigated changes in plasma T helper (Th) cell cytokines, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in 20 patients diagnosed with SARS. Cytokine profile of SARS patients showed marked elevation of Th1 cytokine interferon (IFN)-g , inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and IL-12 for at least 2 weeks after disease onset, but there was no significant elevation of inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a , anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, Th1 cytokine IL-2 and Th2 cytokine IL-4. The chemokine profile demonstrated significant elevation of neutrophil chemokine IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and Th1 chemokine IFN-g -inducible protein-10 (IP-10). Corticosteroid reduced significantly IL-8, MCP-1 and IP-10 concentrations from 5 to 8 days after treatment (all P < 0·001). Together, the elevation of Th1 cytokine IFN-g , inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6 and IL-12 and chemokines IL-8, MCP-1 and IP-10 confirmed the activation of Th1 cell-mediated immunity and hyperinnate inflammatory response in SARS through the accumulation of monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils.	INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a recently emerged infectious disease characterized by persistent fever, respiratory symptoms with lung consolidation, lymphopenia and respiratory failure in life-threatening cases [1] [2] [3] [4] . Watery diarrhoea has also been manifested in some cases [5] . We found that lymphopenia and depletion of CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes could be associated with disease activity and adverse outcomes in SARS [4] . The SARS-related deaths have resulted mainly from pulmonary complications, including progressive respiratory failure due to alveolar damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The causative agent of SARS has been identified as a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [6] [7] [8] with a genome sequence that is only moderately related to other known coronaviruses [9, 10] . Rapid diagnostic tests using molecular techniques for the detection of SARS-CoV RNA have been developed recently [11, 12] . Administration of the antiviral drug ribarivin together with systemic corticosteroid resulted in alleviation of inflammation, reduction of organ dysfunction and improvement on survival in the majority of SARS patients [1, 5, 13] , although controlled clinical trials are required to confirm this regimen's genuine efficacy. It has been shown that the over-production of specific inflammatory cytokines [tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a , interleukin (IL)-1 b , IL-6, IL-10] and polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) CC chemokine IL-8 is the hallmark of viral infection, probably through the activation of transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-k B, activator protein (AP)-1 and activating factor-2 (ATF-2) [14] . For example, the H5N1 'avian flu' influenza viruses are potent inducers of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a in macrophages [15] . In swine pneumonia, the production of TNF-a and IL-6 was found to correlate positively with disease severity [16] . Therefore, SARS sequalae such as transendothelial migration of PMN into lung tissue, multiple organ dysfunction and ARDS have been postulated to associate with cytokine and chemokine dysregulation [17, 18] . In an attempt to study possible SARS-CoV-induced cytokine and chemokine dysregulation, to identify markers for disease severity, and to explore the feasibility of designing effective treatment strategy such as anti-cytokine therapy, we have prospectively investigated a panel of circulating T helper (Th) cell cytokines, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in patients with SARS. | Patients: Our study included 20 consecutive adult patients who were diagnosed to have SARS and admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospi-tal, Hong Kong for treatment from 20 March to 11 April 2003. In accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO), our case definition was a fever (temperature > 38 ∞ C), a chest radiograph or computed tomographic image of the thorax showing evidence of new consolidation with or without respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough and shortness of breath) and a history of close contact with a person in whom SARS had been diagnosed [19] . The diagnosis of SARS was confirmed by an indirect immunofluorescence assay with fetal rhesus kidney cells that were infected with coronavirus and fixed in acetone to detect a serological response to the SARS-CoV [7] , or by a positive viral culture. Our protocol was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Chinese University of Hong Kong and informed consent was obtained from all participants. | Fig. 1.: Box & whiskers plots of changes in plasma cytokine concentrations following day of disease onset in the 20 SARS patients. Normal ranges: (a) IL-1 b < 3·9 ng/l; (b) IL-6 < 3·1 ng/l; (c) IL-10 < 7·8 ng/l; (d) IL-12 < 7·8 ng/l; (e) TNF-a < 10·0 ng/l; and (f) IFN-g < 15·6 ng/l. *Significantly elevated compared to normal values (all P < 0·05). Measurement of plasma cytokines and chemokines EDTA blood samples were collected from SARS patients daily for a maximum of 19 consecutive days. They were immersed in ice and transported immediately to the laboratory for processing. Plasma were separated by centrifugation (2000 g for 10 min) at 4 ∞ C and stored in 300 m l aliquots at -70 ∞ C until analysis. Because the more commonly used procedure of enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) may generate infectious droplets and aerosols, T helper (Th)1/Th2 cytokines, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in plasma were measured serially by cytometric bead array (CBA) using a four-colour FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, CA, USA) located in a Biosafety Level II laboratory [20, 21] . In CBA, five or six bead populations with distinct fluorescence intensities had been coated with capturing antibodies specific for different cytokines or chemokines. These bead populations could be resolved in the fluorescence channels of the flow cytometer. After the beads had been incubated with 50 m l of plasma, different cytokines or chemokines in the sample were captured by their corresponding beads. The cytokine/chemokine captured beads were then mixed with phycoerythrin-conjugated detection antibodies to form sandwich complexes. Following incubation, washing and acquisition of fluorescence data, the results were generated in graphical format using the BD CBA software. The concentrations of Th1/Th2 cytokines IL-2, IL-4 and IFN-g ; inflammatory cytokines IL-1 b , IL-6, IL-10, TNF-a and IL-12p70; and chemokines IL-8, regulated upon activation normal T cell-expressed and secreted (RANTES), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), IFN-g -inducible protein-10 (IP-10) and monokine induced by IFN-g (MIG) were measured using the human Th1/Th2 cytokine, inflammatory cytokine and chemokine CBA kits (BD Pharmingen, CA, USA), respectively. The assay sensitivities of these eight cytokines and five chemokines were 2·6, 2·6, 7·1, 7·2, 2·5, 3·3, 3·7, 1·9, 0·2, 1·0, 2·7, 2·8 and 2·5 ng/l, respectively. The coefficients of variation for all cytokine and chemokine assays were less than 10%. Their respective normal ranges have been derived from measurement of ≥ 100 healthy subjects. | Statistical analysis: Because plasma cytokine and chemokine concentrations were not in a Gaussian distribution, the Mann-Whitney rank sum test was used for assessing their differences. Results were expressed as median (interquartile range). All analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software for Windows, Version 9·0 (SPSS Inc., IL, USA). A probability ( P ) < 0·05 was considered as significantly different. | SARS patients: The characteristics of the 20 SARS patients are summarized in Table 1 . Coincidentally, all except one were female patients, although the female-to-male ratio of the 1755 SARS patients in this outbreak in Hong Kong, as well as that of the 290 patients None of the 20 SARS patients recruited in this study died or required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Initial treatment included antibiotics, cefotaxime and clarithromycin (or levofloxacin) to cover common pathogens causing community-acquired pneumonia. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) was also given initially to treat possible influenza infection. After fever had persisted for more than 48 h and leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or both, had developed, oral ribavirin (40-60 mg/kg/day) and oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) were started as a combined regimen from 2 to 9 days after disease (fever) onset. Patients who did not respond clinically to standard empirical treatment including persistent fever, increasing shortness of breath, worsening lung opacities involving > 50% of lung field in chest radiograph and deteriorating oxygen saturation to < 90% by pulse oximetry, were given intravenous ribavirin (400 mg every 8 h) and an additional one to three pulses of 0·5 g of methylprednisolone sodium succinate (methylprednisolone) daily. | Plasma cytokines of SARS patients: The longitudinal trends of plasma Th1/Th2 cytokines and inflammatory cytokines of the 20 SARS patients are illustrated in Fig. 1 . Th1 cytokine IFN-g and inflammatory cytokines IL-1 b , IL-6 and IL-12 concentrations were significantly elevated above their normal range, respectively, within the first 12, 7 and 5 days after disease onset (all P < 0·05). In contrast, there was no significant increase in proinflammatory cytokine TNF-a in all SARS patients. Anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was found to increase in some but not all patients (no overall significance). The plasma concentrations of Th1 cytokine IL-2 and Th2 cytokine IL-4 of all patients were low and within their respective normal range at all time points (data not shown). | Plasma chemokines of SARS patients: As shown in Fig. 2 , plasma PMN CC chemokine IL-8, monocyte CC chemokine MCP-1 and Th1 CXC chemokine IP-10 concentrations were elevated, respectively, within the first 9, 3 and 14 days after disease onset (all P < 0·05). The overall plasma concentrations of T cell chemoattractants, namely CXC chemokine MIG and CC chemokine RANTES, were not significantly elevated. | Plasma cytokines and chemokines in SARS patients treated and not treated with pulsed methylprednisolone: Among the 20 SARS patients in our cohort, 13 had more severe disease activity including persistent fever and worsening lung opacities; they were additionally given intravenous pulsed methylprednisolone. The other seven patients had milder disease severity and were not treated with pulsed steroid. Figure 3 shows that plasma IFN-g , IL-1 b , IL-6, IL-8, IP-10 and MCP-1 of the former group of patients had higher median concentrations than those of the latter, particularly from day 3-10 after disease onset. Following recovery, the cytokine and chemokine levels decreased progressively to normal values at about 1 week after disease onset for both groups of patients. | Effects of corticosteroid treatment on plasma cytokines and chemokines: As summarized in Table 2 , plasma chemokine IL-8, IP-10 and MCP-1 were significantly reduced to their respective normal ranges from 5 to 8 days after corticosteroid treatment compared to the elevated pretreatment levels (all P < 0·005). These 5-8-day post-treatment concentrations were also significantly lower than those of 1-2 days after treatment (all P < 0·05). All the other measured cytokines and chemokines (IL-1 b , IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, TNF-a , IFN-g , RANTES and MIG) did not show any significant difference before and after corticosteroid treatment. | DISCUSSION: This study was designed to investigate prospectively the longitudinal plasma cytokine and chemokine profile of adult patients with SARS. The progression of this potentially lethal disease may be represented by three phases: acute viral multiplication, hyperactive immune response, recovery or pulmonary destruction and death [1, 4, 5] . Accordingly, it is worthwhile to investigate cytokine and chemokine induction, which may be the cause or consequence of immune hyperactivity in SARS. We observed that for at least 2 weeks after disease onset, all SARS patients exhibited a significant increase in the typical antiviral Th1 cytokine IFN-g and an array of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 b , IL-6 and IL-12), together with a moderate increase in anti-inflammatory IL-10 that was manifested in some patients. IL-1 b can act as the early response cytokine to viral infection such as that caused by the human immunodeficiency virus, for mediation of inflammatory response, synthesis of acute phase proteins and release of IL-8 [14, 22] . IL-6 may play a proinflammatory role in pulmonary inflammation [23] . Th2 cytokine IL-10 is an antiinflammatory cytokine that suppresses the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines [24] , therefore it was elevated in some patients 1 week after disease onset and followed the elevation of other inflammatory cytokines. IL-12, also known as natural killer (NK) cell stimulatory factor or cytotoxic lymphocyte maturation factor, is a pleiotropic proinflammatory cytokine which is produced primarily by antigen-presenting cells (monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and B cells) and PMN [25] . IL-12 can induce the production of IFN-g and other Th1 cytokines with suppression of the Th2 pathway [26, 27] . It has multiple effects on T lymphocytes and NK cells, including the ability to stimulate cytotoxicity, proliferation, cytokine production and the development of Th1 subsets [28, 29] . Therefore, the observed early elevation of inflammatory cytokines IL-1 b , IL-6, IL-12 and IFN-g could be causative of the SARS-CoV-induced activation of Th1 cells and NK cells, release of chemokines such as IL-8, and results in pulmonary inflammation [16] . A previous study has suggested that the infiltration of proinflammatory PMN is involved in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury [30] . PMN are abundant in the airspaces of most ARDS patients with infection, and their secretory products such as myeloperoxidase and elastase in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid can cause acute lung injury [31] [32] [33] . IL-8, the PMN achemokine, has been shown to be elevated in blood and alveolar spaces [34] and exhibit a positive correlation with the number of PMN in BAL fluid of patients with pneumonia and ARDS [35] . Our SARS-CoV-infected patients also showed elevation of plasma IL-8 soon after disease onset, which declined from 5 to 8 days after corticosteroid treatment. In our former clinical study, 82% of 157 SARS patients developed neutrophilia and the high neutrophil counts were associated with ICU admission and mortality from pneumonia [4] . Therefore, PMN-induced acute pneumonitis should be crucial in the pathogenesis of ARDS and pulmonary destruction in SARS patients. Apart from the a -chemokine IL-8, we have also observed elevation of the monocyte/macrophages b -chemokine MCP-1 soon after the onset of SARS, followed by decline after corticosteroid treatment. MCP-1 concentration has been shown to increase in BAL fluid of patients with persistent ARDS [36] , correlating positively with the predominance of alveolar macrophages [37] that has also been found in the postmortem examination of SARS patients [2, 38] . IP-10 is a specific chemoattractant for Th1 cells for the activation of cell-mediated immune response; its expression can be up-regulated by the Th1 cytokine IFN-g in acute lung inflammation [39] . Consistently, our results showed that both circulating IFN-g and IP-10 were increased in SARS patients. Our observation of low or normal Th2 cytokine IL-4 in SARS patients is also similar to the finding of a previous study of viral pneumonia [40] . These suggest that SARS-CoV does not enhance the Th2 pathway and the subsequent humoral immue response. Such imbalance of Th1/Th2 cytokine profile confirms the SARS-CoVinduced Th1 predominance. In contrast to H5N1 infection [15] , plasma TNF-a was not elevated in our patients. This finding, therefore, does not support the therapeutic use of TNF-a monoclonal antibody for SARS. However, it must be cautioned that the concentration of TNF-a at the pulmonary inflammatory sites has not been investigated. Previous studies have implicated that inflammatory IL-b and the acute-phase cytokine IL-6 are endogenous pyrogens or inducers of fever [41] . Therefore, elevations of IL-b and IL-6 might account for the fever onset, as both of them were found to have high plasma concentrations during the first week of disease. Moreover, the T cell chemokines MIG and RANTES also did not show any significantly elevation. Therefore, the recruitment of activated T cells in pulmonary tissue should be studied by performing chemokine assay and differential cell count in BAL fluids, although this should be difficult because of the high risk of infection. In summary, we postulate that the elevation of the plasma chemokines IL-8, MCP-1 and IP-10, Th1-related cytokine IFN-g and IL-12, and inflammatory cytokines IL-1b and IL-6 can induce the hyperinnate inflammatory response due to the SARS-CoV invasion of the respiratory tract. This leads to the recruitment and accumulation of alveolar macrophages and PMN [42] , as well as the activation of Th1 cell-mediated immunity by the stimulation of NK and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Treatment with immunosuppressive corticosteroid can significantly suppress the elevated chemokines IL-8, IP-10 and MCP-1, and subsequently alleviate the chemokine-associated pulmonary inflammation in SARS. Indeed, the reduction in IL-8, IP-10 and MCP-1 correlated with the improvement in general clinical condition, pulmonary function and radiological appearance in SARS patients of our present study. In addition, we also observed that higher disease severity was associated with more elevated plasma IFN-g, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, IP-10 and MCP-1 concentrations (Fig. 3) . It can be postulated that the addition of pulsed steroid in the severe-disease group not only controlled the rapidly deteriorating clinical condition, but basically attenuated the otherwise over-exaggerated immunological response with potentially much high median concentrations of plasma cytokines and chemokines. This further supports that the above cytokines and chemokines played impor-tant roles in the immunopathological mechanisms of SARS. We have initiated a study comparing plasma cytokines and chemokines in SARS patients with and without corticosteroid treatment. The elevated plasma cytokines and chemokines should also shed light on the possibility of using them as prognostic indicators for disease severity in SARS. For example, the presence of high anti-IL-8 : IL-8 complexes in BAL fluid has been shown to be an important prognostic indicator for ARDS [43] . Although our study has provided some understanding of the immunological mechanisms of inflammation in SARS and the therapeutic effects of corticosteroid, many further investigations are required to explore the detailed pathophysiology of this novel emerging disease with global impact. In order to correlate cytokine release with disease severity, in vitro mechanistic study of cytokine induction using SARS-CoV and immune cell culture, and eventually the measurement of cytokine and chemokine concentrations at local inflammatory sites should be contemplated. Other chemokines such as epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide (ENA)-78, a neutrophil chemoattractant [30] , and macrophage inflammatory peptide-1 alpha (MIP-1a), a monocyte chemoattractant [30] , should be measured. Recently, transforming growth factor (TGF)-b has been shown to be active early in acute lung injury, and potentially contribute to the development of pulmonary oedema [44] . Therefore, the role of TGF-b in SARS also requires investigation. Given the prominent roles of cytokines and chemokines in the pathogenesis of SARS, anticytokine/ chemokine immunotherapy using anticytokine/chemokine antibodies (e.g. anti-IL-8, anti-MCP-1) or cytokine/chemokine antagonists may represent a novel approach for the treatment of hyperactive inflammation in SARS [45, 46] .

0003ddc51c4291d742855e9ac56076a3bea33ad7	Journal Pre-proofs The Fire This Time: The Stress of Racism, Inflammation and COVID-19		African Americans, Social Determinants of Health and COVID-19: It is said that crisis reveals character. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the inequitable character of the U.S. health care system by the alarming death rates among African Americans with COVID-19. Nationwide, African Americans represent a third of hospitalized COVID-19 patients but make up only 13% of the U.S. population. In Chicago, one of the nation's hotspots, African American make up 42% of the cases and 56% of the deaths from the virus 1 There are several pathways that contribute to racial disparities in COVID-19 cases and death. First, we must consider biological underpinnings that are specific to COVID-19. Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the entry receptor utilized by COVID-19 and is thought to negatively regulate the activated renin-angiotensin system by diverting the generation of vasoconstrictor angiotensin II (AngII) towards the inactive Ang 1-9 and vasodilatatory Ang 1-7 peptides. A few studies have found racial differences in ACE2 activity, showing African Americans produce higher levels of AngII and demonstrate lower ACE2 activity 3 . Studies have shown that downregulation of ACE2 expression is involved in lung pathology after SARS-CoV infection and elevations in AngII have been directly related to COVID-19 severity 4 . Hence, dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin system may place African Americans at disproportionate risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes. The second, and perhaps most critical factor, relates to health disparities. African Americans disproportionally account for >45% of vascular-related diseases and are 37% more likely to develop lung cancer than whites, despite lower exposure to cigarette smoke. Social determinant factors like economic stability, education, and the environment directly impact issues related to access and quality of health care, which fuel health disparities. Furthermore, there is evidence of medical bias in the testing and treatment of African-American with COVID- We must ask ourselves, "Why do these social inequities persist despite decades of scientific evidence showing its damaging effects on health?" We believe the answer lies in a close examination of structural forms of racism and discrimination towards African Americans. Historically, African Americans have been a target group for racism and discrimination which has created a deep mistrust for societal systems -often undermined as "paranoia." Specific to COVID-19, African Americans are overrepresented in "essential" jobs, therefore, employment may interfere with the ability to stay at home and social distance. We must not forget that stay at home orders and social distancing carries an assumption of socioeconomic privilege (I.e., the ability to work from home and transition from in-person communications to online platforms). | Biological consequences of the stress of racism: COVID-19 has brought these longstanding issues to light in a stark way. What is less appreciated are the biological consequences of structural racism and discrimination. Increasing evidence support the effects of racial discrimination on biological function. First, altered immune function, hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA) dysfunction, and metabolic changes secondary to stress can contribute to medical co-morbidities such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension and asthma, all of which increase COVID-19 risk. Everyday discrimination is a stressor that has been linked to poor health, inflammation, and premature cellular aging 6 . Hence, discrimination experiences may also explain why African Americans are at a disproportionately higher risk for poor medical (e.g., cardiovascular disease, metabolic, hypertension) and psychiatric outcomes (e.g., depression, anxiety). Disparities in health outcomes may also reflect dysfunctions in the body's innate (immediate) and adaptive (prolonged) immune responses, which are evolutionarily designed to defend against and prevent the spread of pathogens. During initial exposure to a new pathogen, Tolllike receptors play a critical role in innate and inflammatory immune responses. Dysfunctional alterations in the adaptive immune response may promote a "cytokine storm", whereby the immune system begins to attack its own cells and tissues 7 which has been seen in severe cases of COVID-19. The field of social genomics has uncovered how certain marginalized groups demonstrate abnormal patterns of gene expression in genes responsible for innate immunity, termed the Conserved Transcriptional Response to Adversity (CTRA 8 ). CTRA refers to a common pattern of transcriptional alterations that is activated by chronic low-grade activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). The CTRA profile is characterized by increased expression of genes involved in inflammation, and decreased expression of genes involved in innate antiviral responses and genes encoding specific isotypes of antibodies (IgG in particular). Experiences of racial discrimination have been found to explain more than 50% of the Black-White differences in CTRA, particularly in genes that promote inflammation 9 . Together, these studies provide a potential pathway as to how racism and discrimination alter host innate immunity to promote abnormal inflammatory responses. | Neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19: The neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 have both direct and indirect pathways. The direct pathway relates to the stress-induced inflammatory factors (as described above) that may increase risk for encephalopathies, depression, anxiety, and trauma-related disorders 10 . It is hypothesized that these neuropsychiatric manifestations could result from the virus-induced "cytokine storm". The indirect pathway relates to measures to address the pandemic like social distancing as well as the economic toll of COVID-19. There is growing concern that these indirect consequences of COVID-19 may contribute to isolation, anxiety, depression, and increased rates of suicide 11 . As a result of these direct and indirect pathways, African Americans are specifically vulnerable to the neuropsychiatric consequences of COVID-19. | Conclusions: The crisis generated by the COVID-19 pandemic has forced us to confront issues of inequality and health disparities. While considerable efforts are being made to "flatten the curve", it does not negate the damage that has already been done, particularly in the African American community. While the virus is not thought to target specific racial or ethnic groups, we cannot ignore that African Americans have been disproportionately impacted. As we think about getting past this crisis and getting back to "normal", the pandemic provides an opportunity to improve our health system to reduce disparities. In sum, understanding the key biological and psychosocial contributors to the ravishes of COVID-19 in African Americans highlights the need for more vigilance, attention, and efforts to improve health for all.

0004456994f6c1d5db7327990386d33c01cff32a    Background: Influenza immunisation for healthcare workers is encouraged to protect their often vulnerable patients but also due to a perceived higher risk for influenza. We aimed to compare the risk of influenza infection in healthcare workers in acute hospital care with that in non-healthcare workers over the same season. Methods: We conducted a prospective, multicentre cohort study during the 2006/07 influenza season in Berlin, Germany. Recruited participants gave serum samples before and after the season, and completed questionnaires to determine their relevant exposures and possible confounding factors. The main outcome measure was serologically confirmed influenza infection (SCII), defined as a fourfold or greater rise in haemagglutination inhibition antibody titres to a circulating strain of influenza (with post-season titre at least 1:40). Weekly mobile phone text messages were used to prompt participants to report respiratory illnesses during the influenza season. A logistic regression model was used to assess the influence of potential risk factors. Results: We recruited 250 hospital healthcare workers (mean age 35.7 years) and 486 non-healthcare workers (mean age 39.2 years) from administrative centres, blood donors and colleges. Overall SCII attack rate was 10.6%. Being a healthcare worker was not a risk factor for SCII (relative risk 1.1, p = 0.70). The final multivariate model had three significant factors: living with children (odds ratio [OR] 3.7, p = 0.005), immunization (OR 0.50, p = 0.02), and -among persons living in households without children -ownership of a car (OR 3.0, p = 0.02). Living with three or more children (OR 13.8, p < 0.01) was a greater risk than living with one or two children (OR 5.3, p = 0.02). 30% of participants with SCII reported no respiratory illness. Healthcare workers were at slightly higher risk of reporting any respiratory infection than controls (adjusted OR 1.3, p = 0.04, n = 850). Our results suggest that healthcare workers in hospitals do not have a higher risk of influenza than non-healthcare workers, although their risk of any respiratory infection is slightly raised. Household contacts seem to be more important than exposure to patients. Car ownership is a surprise finding which needs further exploration. Asymptomatic infections are common, accounting for around a third of serologically confirmed infections.	Background: The German standing commission for immunisation, along with other authorities [1] [2] [3] currently recommends that healthcare workers (HCWs) be vaccinated against seasonal influenza. Two reasons are cited: firstly that HCWs can be a source of infection for vulnerable people under their care [1] [2] [3] , and secondly that HCWs are at increased risk for contracting influenza [1] . Vaccination of HCWs should theoretically reduce the risk of influenza infection both in themselves and their patients. There is evidence to support the first reason for vaccination, the protection of patients. HCWs can transmit influenza to those under their care during both outbreaks and non-outbreak situations [4] [5] [6] [7] . Low vaccination rates in HCWs have been associated with nosocomial outbreaks [4, 8] , and higher vaccination rates with reduced nosocomial influenza incidences [7] . HCWs may transmit influenza to those under their care, but is there evidence that their occupational exposures (to patients, relatives, colleagues and the hospital environment) confer an increased risk of influenza compared to the general population? Influenza serological attack rates in HCWs of 23% (single season, [9] ) and 14% (an average of two seasons, [10] ) have been documented. However, as serological attack rates of influenza may vary considerably from season to season as well as from location to location, without the inclusion of a comparison group of non-HCWs neither study could demonstrate an increased risk. Another aspect of influenza in HCWs is that many HCWs argue that they withdraw from work when they become ill with influenza-like illness to reduce their risk of transmitting influenza to their patients. However, not all serologically diagnosed influenza infections experience an influenza-like illness, and a proportion will be asymptomatic. The frequency of asymptomatic influenza infection in HCWs has been assessed in volunteer studies (33%, [11] ), a cohort study (28%, [9] ) and one randomised controlled study (42%, [10] ). The objective of this study was to address the question of whether HCWs in the acute care hospital setting have a higher risk of serologically confirmed influenza infections (SCII) than non-HCWs, and to assess the proportion of individuals with SCII who experience either any respiratory symptoms or an influenza-like illness. | Methods: We conducted our study in people living or working in Berlin during the influenza season of 2006/07, using a multicentre, prospective cohort design. There were 11 study sites: three hospitals, two administrative centres (the Robert Koch Institute and Vivantes Healthcare administrative centre), four blood-donation centres and two colleges. HCWs and some non-HCWs were sought from the hospitals, but only non-HCWs were sought from all other sites. We recruited participants through occupational health services in the hospitals and one administrative centre; through direct recruitment at blood donation centres; and through active recruitment during site visits at the other study sites (non-healthcare workers from one administrative centre and two colleges). On recruitment before the influenza season, consenting participants gave a single serum sample and completed an exposure questionnaire. Details recorded included age, sex, type of employment, risk factors for influenza, smoking status, and vaccination status. Where participants had been vaccinated fewer than 14 days before the sample was taken, or were found to have been vaccinated shortly after the initial sample was taken, a second sample, taken at least 14 days after vaccination, was sought through direct recall or through occupational health. Blood samples were refrigerated, then transported within three days to the national reference laboratory for influenza at the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin, where they were centrifuged and frozen. | Inclusion and exclusion criteria: HCW in our context were defined as people working on a daily basis with unwell patients in an acute hospital setting, including nurses (trainee and qualified) and doctors. Non-HCW were those working or studying at the study sites, or attending the blood donation centres, who did not fit the definition of HCW. Exclusions (applied to both HCWs and non-HCWs) were: people with patient contact in the community (such as community doctors and nurses, dentists, and pharmacists); people working in care homes; laboratory workers who had contact with respiratory samples or with influenza virus; people who planned to be away from Berlin for more than two weeks during the projected season (January to April); and people who did not wish to be contacted weekly by mobile phone Short Message System (SMS) or email. For the analysis of serologically-confirmed infections, we excluded vaccinated individuals where the baseline serum sample was taken fewer than 14 days after vaccination, or where a later second sample was not obtainable (see recruitment above). These participants were excluded from the serological analyses as any titre rise could have been caused by vaccination and not infection. Because pigs can carry influenza viruses, and participants with pig contact were associated with SCII, participants reporting contact with pigs were excluded. | Active surveillance for respiratory infections during influenza season: In order to document weekly occurrences of respiratory infections during the influenza season, we contacted all participants weekly through SMS or through email, asking them if they had experienced a "new" respiratory infection during the previous 7 days. Where participants answered "yes", they were contacted by telephone and details of their infection were obtained using an illness questionnaire. Weekly surveillance for respiratory infections covered the period from January 13, 2007 to March 30, 2007, a period chosen to coincide with the influenza season. This strategy was employed in order to maximise the predictive value of a positive answer. | Postseason follow-up: After the influenza season, participants were recalled by SMS or email. They gave a second serum sample and completed a further questionnaire, including repeat questions on vaccination status and employment type; number of patient contacts on a typical day between January 13 and April 6, 2007; broad age classification of patient contacts (adults (>17 years) and children (<18 years); clinical specialty and usage of facemasks (for HCWs); daily professional and household contacts; use of public transport and car ownership; contact with pigs (for veterinary students); and vaccination in previous years. Participants were asked again if they had had respiratory infections over the period January 13, 2007 to 6 th April 2007, extending the period of surveillance to one week after the last weekly SMS was sent. Contact was defined as either touching or having a two way conversation with someone close by, or (for patient contact only) examining or giving care to a patient. Participants were asked to estimate the number of contacts made during a typical day in household and work settings. | Laboratory investigations: The paired blood samples were defrosted and antibody titres were determined on the same day using the haemagglutination inhibition test to determine infection in any of the two A subtypes or the two B lineages. We tested for antibody to the following strains: Titres of below 10 were assigned the value of 5 in order to allow calculation of the titre rise. SCII was defined as a fourfold or greater titre rise between preand post-season samples, with a postseason titre of at least 40. As A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2) and A/ California/07/2004 (H3N2) were closely related a titre rise to either of these strains was considered as a single SCII due to A/H3N2. | Outcomes: The primary outcome was evidence of SCII by any of the above strains. The clinical outcomes were influenza-like-illness (ILI), defined as an illness with an acute onset, self-reported fever, cough, and head or body pains; and acute respiratory infection (ARI), defined as any reported infection with coryza (nasal discharge) or cough. Clinical outcomes were based only on completed illness questionnaires or postseason illness reports, not on SMS or email replies, the latter being used only as the prompt for collection of illness data. Where illness was reported over more than one week, symptoms for each week were combined to produce a single illness episode. To produce an epidemic curve of SCII with any ILI, or in its absence, another ARI, the respective dates of illness onset were plotted. Where more than one illness episode was reported, we used the onset date of the episode closest to the peak, on the assumption that this episode was the most likely to be due to influenza virus. | Statistical analysis: We undertook bivariate analyses for all binary exposure variables and calculated risk ratios (RR), their 95% confidence interval and p-values. For the comparison of the exposure groups (HCW vs. non-HCW) continuous variables were analysed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. For the analysis of the association with SCII continuous variables were explored by grouping them in categories. We regarded a p-value of less than 0.05 as statistically significant. We then constructed a multivariate logistic regression model (logistic command, STATA [StataCorp. 2007. Stata statistical software: Release 10. College Station, TX: Statacorp LP]) using variables which were associated with the outcome with a p-value of less than 0.1 in the bivariate analysis. Variables with p values between 0.1 and 0.2, along with healthcare worker status, were also tested in the final model. In order to determine whether the site of recruitment had any group-level effects on the model, we constructed a random-effects logistic regression model with the same variables as the standard model plus study site as the grouping variable, and a likelihood ratio test for the proportion of variance attributable to the group level (rho) was performed (xtlogit, STATA). | Data protection and ethical approval: The data protection protocol was approved by both state and national data protection offices in Berlin, and shared with all study partners. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the University of Berlin, faculty of medicine (Charité) ethics committee. | Recruitment and follow-up: We recruited 1044 participants, of which 736 (71%) were included in the analysis with SCII as outcome, and 866 (93%) for the clinical outcome analysis ( Figure 1 ). Those not included in the study were of younger age (38 vs 34, p < 0.01 Kruskall-Wallis) and were more likely to be HCW at recruitment (42% vs 34%, p < 0.01), but there were no significant differences in sex, current immunisation, smoking status, car ownership or use of public transport in excluded versus non-excluded participants. | Comparison of study participants by healthcare worker status: Of the 736 participants included in the analysis with the outcome SCII 250 (34%) were HCWs and 486 (66%) were non-HCWs. Most participants (71%) were female. The age distribution was bimodal, with peaks in the age groups 20-29 years and 40-49 years both in HCWs and non-HCWs. Of the 250 healthcare workers, 41 (16%) were doctors, 97 (39%) were trainee nurses and 112 (45%) were qualified nurses. Of the 486 non-healthcare workers, 178 (36%) were administrative or information technology staff, 107 (22%) scientific staff, 45 (9%) students, 6 (1%) teaching or lecturing staff, 25 (5%) in manual or technical roles, 21 (4%) in retail or service, 9 (2%) veterinary staff, and 7 (1%) in other occupations. In 88/486 (18%) the occupation was not stated or unclear. Table 1 compares study characteristics in the exposure group (HCW) and control group (non-HCW). HCWs were significantly younger than controls (35.7 versus 39.2, Kruskal-Wallis test, p < 0.01). They were also significantly more likely to be current smokers, female, vaccinated in the current season, and to own a car. Healthcare workers had significantly more non-patient contacts at work (mean 14.3 versus 13.8, p = 0.021) but fewer contacts at home (mean 2.7 versus 3.5, P < 0.01) There were no significant differences in immunisation in the previous three seasons, or in household exposure to children. HCWs were significantly less likely to have a titer of <40 against A/California/07/2004, the A/ H3N2-strain of the previous season. | Serologically confirmed influenza infection and ILI/ARI: In total there were 82 titer rises among 78 participants. Of these, 13 (16%) were due to A/New Caledonia/20/ 1999 (H1N1), 64 (78%) due to either of the two A/ H3N2-strains tested, two (2%) due to B/Malaysia/2506/ 2004 and three (4%) due to B/Jiangsu/10/2003. There were four double-infections, three with H3N2/H1N1 coinfections and one with titre rises to both B strains. Table 2 shows SCII and reported infections by healthcare worker status. The overall attack rate for SCII was 10.6% (78/736). Of the 78 people with evidence of SCII, 23 (30%) reported neither ARI nor ILI, 33 (42%) reported at least one ARI but no ILI, and 22 (28%) reported at least one ILI. | Bivariate analysis: risk factors for SCII: HCWs did not have a significantly higher risk of SCII than non-HCWs (RR 1.09, p = 0.70). In addition, neither working as a nurse (RR = 0.94, p = 0.82) nor as a doctor was significant (RR = 1.76, p = 0.13). There was also no significant difference in the risk of SCII between HCWs and controls after stratification by vaccination status, car ownership, having children, or regular use of public transport. There were three exposures with p-values below 0.1: vaccination, having a car in the household and having three or more children at home (Table 3) . Household contacts increased the unadjusted risk of SCII ( Figure 2 ). Attack rates were lowest in those living alone (4%), intermediate in those living with adults but no children (10%) or one or two children (12%), and highest in those with three or more children in the household (24%). In a stratified analysis, the effect of car ownership was significant when participants did not live with children (RR = 2.77, p = 0.01), but not for participants who lived in a household with children (RR = 0.98, p = 1.00). | Multivariate model: Variables significantly associated with SCII were the type of household contact environment, car ownership, and vaccination status (Table 4 ). Living with children was associated with an increased risk of SCII, with an overall odds ratio of 3.7 (p < 0.01, separate model without stratification of household contacts). Three or more children in the household (OR13.8, p < 0.01) were a greater risk than one or two children (OR 5.3, p = 0.02). Household car ownership was a significant risk factor only among persons living in households without children and had an odds ratio for SCII of 3.0 (p = 0.02), while owning a car in households with children was not statistically significant (OR = 0.95; p = 0.94) and so was not included in the final model. Immunisation against influenza was associated with an OR of 0.50 (p = 0.02). Vaccine effectiveness against SCII was therefore 50% (95%CI 12-71%). Effectiveness against SCII with a reported ILI was higher at 73% (95%CI 6-92%; p = 0.04). Other variables were added to the multivariate model, but were found not to be significant at the p < 0.2 level. These were being a doctor; having 7 or more child patient contacts; and being a healthcare worker. Addition of a group-level variance term for recruitment site to the random-effects model was not statistically significant (p(rho = 0) > = 0.498). | Risk factors for any ARI: The four variables with a p-value < 0.2 in the bivariate analysis were age below 51 (p = 0.02), female sex (p = 0.03), HCW (p = 0.03) and smoking (p = 0.12). In the multivariate model (n = 850) all except female sex (p = 0.054) were significant, and the effect of smoking became statistically significant. Age below 51 (OR 1.44, p = 0.04), female sex (OR 1.36, p = 0.05) and HCW status (OR 1.34, p = 0.04) had an OR above 1, and smoking had an OR below 1 (OR 0.72, p = 0.04). Figure 3 shows the distribution of dates of onset for all SCII where an episode of ARI or ILI was reported. | Temporal progression of influenza cases: The peak seen in week 9 corresponded with the peak number of positive influenza tests from Berlin patients performed at the national reference laboratory for influenza, from patient samples collected through the German influenza sentinel surveillance system [12] . | Discussion: We found no significant association between being a healthcare worker in acute hospital care and serogically confirmed influenza infection. Instead we identified household contacts, in particular children, and car ownership, as important risk factors for SCII. 30% of participants with SCII reported no symptoms, and only around one-quarter of those reporting influenza-like illness also had SCII. We did not demonstrate a strongly increased risk of influenza infection in HCWs in acute hospital care. As HCWs do appear to have an increased risk for ARI (OR = 1.3) it would be plausible to expect an effect of similar order for influenza infections. Although study limitations might have led to a failure to detect a true increase, it is unlikely that we have missed a large difference in the risk of influenza. Why might HCWs in hospital not have a higher risk of influenza? The prevalence of infectious influenza in patients may have been low, either due to the absence of influenza patients or because patients admitted later in the course of illness might have been less infectious. Also, infection control measures such as use of personal protective equipment and individual or cohort isolation might have reduced the risks of infection in HCWs. Lastly, prior immunity may have played a role. HCWs were less likely than non-HCWs to be susceptible (preseason titer of less than 40) to A/California/07/2004 (H3N2), which was the A/H3N2 strain of the previous season and related to A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), the dominant strain in the 2006/07 season. As most influenza patients admitted to hospitals are children or older people, one might expect to find an increased risk for SCII in HCWs who work with these patient groups. Our finding of an elevated odds ratio for HCWs with more frequent contact with child patients, albeit not significant in this setting, would be consistent with this supposition. Another study focusing on this hypothesis is needed to investigate it further. Household contacts, and in particular children in the home, were the main significant risk factors identified in Table 4 Logistic regression model for persons with serologically confirmed influenza infection as outcome (n = 727) Exposure Number Figure 3 Cases of serologically confirmed influenza infection reporting acute respiratory illness (ARI; blue) and influenza-like illness (ILI; red), by date of onset of reported illness (n = 53). Green line (on secondary y-axis): smoothed line of influenza cases in Berlin identified at the national reference laboratory for influenza from samples collected within the German sentinel surveillance system [12] . this study. This finding is similar to that in another droplet-transmitted infection, meningitis, where household contacts constitute by far the most important risk group [13] . We found a strong dose-response relationship for child household contacts. The role of children as the main sources of influenza transmission has been suggested in several studies [14] [15] [16] [17] . Adult household contacts may play a role analogous, but possibly less marked, to that of children. Whilst public transport usage was not associated with SCII, car ownership was a significant risk factor, albeit only in households without children. This was unexpected, as car ownership was only included as a counterpart question to public transport usage. For this reason, further details on passengers, frequency or duration of car use were not obtained in the study. Possession of a car has not previously been recognised as a risk factor for influenza acquisition. However, sharing a car does involve prolonged close contact in an enclosed space and has been linked to transmission of one airborne pathogen [18] . In one observational study on risk factors for SARS in China "using a taxi more than once a week" was identified as independent risk factor for SARS infection with an increased odds ratio close to significance (p = 0.07). Furthermore, this variable was kept in the multivariate model while "riding a bus" and "taking the subway" (who were significant in bivariate analysis) were not [19] . Ownership of a car may also be a marker for having a greater number of social contacts, perhaps including children. Car users are also exposed to air pollution from other vehicles, and this may predispose users to respiratory infections. Despite the unexpected nature of this finding, it is possible that car usage is indeed a risk factor and should be explored through further studies. We did not find an increased risk of influenza in the 58% of participants who were regular users of public transport. Public transport usage has been cited as a possible risk factor for influenza infection, particularly in the context of pandemic planning [20] . In a recent international survey of precautionary behaviour for pandemic influenza, 75% of respondents said that they would avoid public transport [21] . Both rail and air travel have been associated with respiratory infection transmission [22, 23] . Whilst it is possible to contract influenza on public transport, our results suggest that, at least in Berlin, using public transport does not increase a person's risk of influenza. In Berlin, crowding on public transport is infrequent and not extreme, so this result may not be generalisable to cities with different conditions. Vaccine uptake was relatively high both in HCWs (42%) and non-HCWs (32%). Reasons for this high HCW uptake include the participation of a hospital from former East Germany where vaccination uptake in hospitals is still found to be higher than in West German hospitals. In non-HCWs, the participation of a federal public health institute where influenza vaccination is freely offered to employees may account for the high vaccination rate. High vaccination uptake limited the number of SCII and reduced the study power. Vaccination effectiveness was 50% against SCII and reached 73% for a more severe outcome, SCII with reported ILI. Only 28% of participants with SCII reported an ILI, the majority reporting no symptoms or more minor respiratory illness. The proportion of asymptomatic infections (30% or more) was substantial and similar to that reported by Elder (28%, [9] and consistent with an estimated proportion of 33% obtained from pooled challenge studies [10] . In addition, only 26% of persons with an ILI had evidence of an influenza infection. Thus, the ILI-syndrome was a poor marker for influenza infections. Unvaccinated HCWs who intend to withdraw from work when they become ill with influenza-typical symptoms may overlook many (symptomatic or asymptomatic) influenza infections, putting patients at unnecessary risk. The association of HCW status and ARI may reflect the fact that HCWs communicate with or care for a large number of people including patients, colleagues, and relatives, and are thus exposed to a wide variety of respiratory pathogens. The reduced risk for ARI in people aged over 50 years might be explained by their cumulative immune experience or a lower contact rate. The apparent protective effect of smoking could be due to lower ascertainment of ARI in this group, where a background of smoking-related symptoms may have masked the onset of an additional, mild infectious respiratory illness. Conversely, respiratory symptoms due to non-infectious causes may be over-reported in non-smokers. What significance does this study have for the current H1N1v pandemic? As pandemic influenza should result in a higher attack rate than seasonal influenza, the prevalence of influenza in hospital inpatients and staff is likely to be higher than for seasonal influenza, so increasing the risk of exposure and infection for HCWs compared to that described here. For the same reasons, the risk in HCWs and non-HCWs from their household contacts would also be higher than for seasonal influenza. Therefore even if a repeat study during pandemic conditions identified a significant occupational risk for HCWs, household exposures might still be more strongly associated with influenza infection. This study was subject to a number of limitations. As recruiting at the hospital and one administrative study site was done through the occupational health departments, only a small proportion (fewer than 10%) of the HCWs at these sites were enrolled in the study. Selection bias could have concealed any actual relationship between HCWs status and influenza infection, if HCWs with a lower risk of influenza than their non-recruited colleagues were to have enrolled, or if non-HCWs with a higher risk of influenza enrolled. It is possible that HCWs with a higher number of patient contacts and, therefore in theory a higher risk of influenza, would be less likely to participate due to pressure of work. Alternatively, HCWs who were concerned about their higher risk of influenza may have protected themselves better and may have been more likely than other HCWs to participate, which would tend to decrease the relative risk in this group. Loss of recruited participants, mostly due to losses to follow up (despite repeated attempts to contact) and to the timing of vaccination, reduced the effective power of the study and may have worsened selection bias, although excluded participants did not differ significantly with respect to variables found to influence the outcome. Although there were differences between the two comparison groups with respect to sex, recent immunisation, smoking and use of public transport, the logistic regression methods should have adjusted for these where they had an effect on the outcome (in particular immunisation). The lower average age and higher proportion of females in the HCW group is likely to be due to recruitment among trainee nurses in the larger hospitals. Serological testing for influenza infection alone, rather than molecular testing methods, may have underestimated the true number of influenza infections [24] . This, along with the relatively high vaccination uptake, will have reduced the number of SCII and thus the effective study power. With an attack rate of 10% in non-healthcare workers, the sample size of 736 analysed would not have been sufficient to detect a relative risk below 1.8 (80% power, 5% significance). We explored the possibility of influenza clustering due to site-level group influences or localized influenza outbreaks. Analysis of symptom onset dates revealed no evidence of separate site-specific outbreaks, but instead the epidemic curves at each study site followed the overall trend. In addition the multilevel analysis suggested that there were no significant group-level influences on the outcome. | Conclusions: Our study results suggest that HCWs in an acute hospital care setting are at no higher risk of influenza than the general public, or that if they are, the increased risk is modest. Household contacts, particularly children, play an important role with individuals with three or more children being at highest risk. Use of public transport does not increase the risk of influenza, whereas (in the absence of household children) car ownership does seem to significantly increase the risk for influenza infection, although the mechanism is unclear. Further research would help to clarify the role of household contacts of different age groups, the relevance of car ownership, and whether subgroups of hospital HCWsor HCWs in other settings, such as in primary care,are at increased risk for influenza infection. Finally, the ILI-syndrome is a poor marker for influenza infection, suggesting that HCWs cannot rely on this syndrome if they wish to confidently protect their patients but, should instead be vaccinated.
