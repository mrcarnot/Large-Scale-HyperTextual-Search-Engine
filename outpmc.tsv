PMC1054884	Recombination Every Day: Abundant Recombination in a Virus during a Single Multi-Cellular Host Infection		Introduction: As increasing numbers of full-length viral sequences become available, recombinant or mosaic viruses are being recognized more frequently [1,2,3]. Recombination events have been demonstrated to be associated with viruses expanding their host range [4,5,6,7] or increasing their virulence [8,9], thus accompanying, or perhaps even being at the origin of, major changes during virus adaptation. It remains unclear, however, whether recombination events represent a highly frequent and significant phenomenon in the everyday life of these viruses. Viruses can exchange genetic material when at least two different viral genomes co-infect the same host cell. Progeny can then become hybrid through different mechanisms, such as reassortment of segments when the parental genomes are fragmented [10], intra-molecular recombination when polymerases switch templates (in RNA viruses) [11], or homologous or non-homologous recombination (in both RNA and DNA viruses). Quantification of viral recombination in multi-cellular organisms has been attempted under two distinct experimental approaches: in vitro (in cell cultures) [12,13,14,15], and in vivo (in live hosts) [16,17,18]. The in vitro approach, which has so far been applied only to animal viruses, allows the establishment of the “intrinsic” recombination rate in experimentally co-infected cells in cell cultures [14,15,19]. However, it does not necessarily reflect the situation in entire, living hosts, where the frequency of co-infected cells is poorly known and depends on many factors such as the size of the pathogen population, the relative frequency and distribution of the different variants, and host defense mechanisms preventing secondary infection of cells. The in vivo experimental approach is closer to biological conditions and may thus be more informative of what actually happens in “the real world.” However, as discussed below, numerous experimental constraints have so far precluded an actual quantification of the baseline rate of recombination. First, many experimental designs have used extreme positive selection, where only recombinant genomes were viable (e.g., [13,20,21]). Other studies did not use complementation techniques but detected recombinants by PCR within infected hosts or tissues [18,22,23,24,25], which provides information on their presence but not on their frequency in the viral population. So far, no quantitative PCR or other quantitative method has been applied to evaluate the number of recombinants appearing in an experimentally infected live host. Finally, recent methods based on sequence analysis inferred the population recombination rate, rather than the individual recombination rate [1,26,27]. While results from these methods certainly take in vivo recombination into account, there are other caveats: isolates have often been collected in different hosts—sometimes in different geographical regions—and sometimes the selective neutrality of sequence variation on which these estimates are based is not clearly established. Estimates from such studies by essence address the estimation of the recombination rate at a different evolutionary scale. Taken together, the currently available information indicates that no viral recombination rate has ever been estimated directly at time and space scales corresponding to a single multi-cellular host infection, although this level is most significant for the biology and evolution of viruses. This study intends to fill this gap by evaluating the recombination frequency of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) during a single passage in one of its host plants (the turnip Brassica rapa). CaMV is a pararetrovirus, which is a major grouping containing hepadnaviruses (e.g., hepatitis B virus), badnaviruses (e.g., banana streak virus), and caulimoviruses (e.g., CaMV). Pararetroviruses are characterized by a non-segmented double-stranded DNA genome. After entering the host cell nucleus, the viral DNA accumulates as a minichromosome [28] whose transcription is ensured by the host RNA polymerase II [29]. The CaMV genome consists in approximately 8,000 bp and encodes six viral gene products that have been detected in planta (Figure 1) [30]. Viral proteins P1 to P6 are expressed from two major transcripts, namely a 19S RNA, encoding P6, and a 35S RNA corresponding to the entire genome and serving as mRNA for proteins P1–P5 [31]. Using the pre-genomic 35S RNA as a matrix, the protein P5 (product of gene V) reverse-transcribes the genome into genomic DNA that is concomitantly encapsidated [30]. The detection of CaMV recombinants in turnip hosts has been reported numerous times. Some studies have demonstrated the appearance of infectious recombinant viral genomes after inoculation (i) of a host plant with two infectious or non-infectious parental clones [21,32,33,34,35] or (ii) of a transgenic plant containing one CaMV transgene with a CaMV genome missing the corresponding genomic region [36]. While the former revealed inter-genomic viral recombination, the latter demonstrated that CaMV can also recombine with transgenes within the host's genome. Another study based on phylogenetic analyses of various CaMV strains has clearly suggested different origins for different genomic regions and, hence, multiple recombination events during the evolution of this virus [37]. Indirect experimental evidence has indicated that, in some cases, CaMV recombination could occur within the host nucleus, between different viral minichromosomes, presumably through the action of the DNA repair cellular machinery [21,35]. Nevertheless, the mechanism of “template switching” during reverse transcription, predominant in all retroviruses, most certainly also applies to pararetroviruses. For this reason, and on the basis of numerous experimental data, CaMV is generally believed to recombine mostly in the cytoplasm of the host cell, by “legal” template switching between two pre-genomic RNA molecules [21,35,36,38,39], or “illegal” template switching between the 19S and the 35S RNA [36,40]. Under this hypothesis, recombination in CaMV could therefore be considered as operating on a linear template during reverse transcription, with the 5′ and 3′ extremities later ligated to circularize the genomic DNA (position 0 in Figure 1). The above cited studies clearly demonstrate that CaMV is able to recombine. However, since these studies are based on complementation techniques, non-quantitative detection, or phylogenetically based inferences of recombination, they do not inform us on whether recombination is an exceptional event or an “everyday” process shaping the genetic composition of CaMV populations. In the present work, we aimed at answering this question. To this end, we have constructed a CaMV genome with four genetic markers, demonstrated to be neutral in competition experiments. By co-inoculating host plants with equal amounts of wild-type and marker-containing CaMV particles, we have generated mixed populations in which impressive proportions of recombinants—distributed in several different classes corresponding to exchange of different genomic regions—have been detected and quantified. Altogether, the recombinant genomes averaged over 50% of the population. Further analysis of these data, assuming a number of viral replications during the infection period ranging from five to 20, indicates that the per nucleotide per replication cycle recombination rate of CaMV is of the same order of magnitude, i.e., on the order of a few 10−5, across the entire genome. We thereby provide the first quantification, to our knowledge, of the recombination rate in a virus population during a single passage in a single host. | Recombinant Frequency in CaMV Populations from Co-Infected Plants ::: Results: From Figure 1, and supposing that all marker-containing genomic regions can recombine, we could predict the detection and quantification of seven classes of recombinant genotypes: +bcd/a+++, a+cd/+b++, ab+d/++c+, abc+/+++d, ++cd/ab++, a++d/+bc+, and a+c+/+b+d. Indeed, all classes were detected, and their frequencies in the ten CaMV populations analyzed are summarized in Table 1. Altogether, the proportion of recombinant genomes found in the mixed viral populations was astonishingly high and very similar in the ten co-infected plants analyzed (Table 1, last column), ranging between 44% (plant 5) to 60% (plants 7, 12, and 20), with a mean frequency (± standard error) of 53.8% ± 2.0%. This result indicates that recombination events are very frequent during the invasion of the host plant by CaMV and represents, to our knowledge, the first direct quantification of viral recombination during the infection of a live multi-cellular host. | Probability of Recombination between Various Pairs of Markers ::: Results: The inferred per generation recombination and interference rates, assuming that CaMV undergoes ten replication cycles during the 21 d between infection and sampling, are given for each of the ten plants in Table 2. Recombination rates between adjacent markers are large, on the order of 0.05 to 0.1. Taking the distance in nucleotides between markers into account yields an average recombination rate per nucleotide and generation on the order of 4 × 10−5. Interestingly, this recombination rate does not vary throughout the genome (Kruskal–Wallis test, p = 0.16). To relax the assumption of the number of replications during the 21 d, we calculated the recombination parameters assuming five or 20 generations. The effect of the number of generations on the estimates is linear: doubling the number of generations results in a halving of the recombination rate (detailed results not shown). For example, the average recombination rates r 1, r 2, and r 3 assuming 20 generations were equal to 0.05, 0.04, and 0.025, respectively (compare with values in Table 2), yielding per nucleotide per generation recombination rates of 1.9 × 10−5, 2.2 × 10−5 and 1.6 × 10−5. Inspection of Table 2 also shows that first-order interference coefficients were in general negative, indicating that a crossing over in one genomic segment increases the probability that a crossing over will occur in another genomic segment, while the second-order coefficient parameter had an average value close to zero with a large variance. The mechanism leading to these results will be discussed in the following section. | Discussion: One major breakthrough in the work presented here lies in the space and time scales at which the experiments were performed. Indeed, the processes occurring within the course of a single infection of one multi-cellular host are of obvious biological relevance for any disease. Previous studies on viral recombination suffered from major drawbacks in this respect, basing their conclusions on experiments relying on complementation among non-infectious viruses or between viruses with undetermined relative fitness, on phylogenetically based analyses, or on experiments in cell cultures. For reasons detailed in the Introduction, the first two methods either do not provide information on the frequency of recombination, but only its occurrence, or address the question at a different temporal, and often spatial, scale. Results from cell cultures, on the other hand, impose cell co-infection by different viral variants, potentially overestimating the frequency of recombination events. Our study circumvents these limitations by analyzing viral genotypes sampled from infected plants after the course of a single infection, and therefore the invasion and co-infection of cells in various organs and tissues is very close to natural. More than half of the genomes (53.8% ± 2.0%; see Table 1) present in a CaMV population after a single passage in its host plant were identified as recombinants, and these data allowed us to infer a per nucleotide per generation recombination rate on the order of 2 × 10−5 to 4 × 10−5. The time length of one generation, i.e., the time required for a given genome to go from one replication to the next, is totally unknown in plant viruses. The only experimental data available on CaMV are based on the kinetics of gene expression in infected protoplasts, where the capsid protein is produced between 48 and 72 h [40]. The reverse transcription and the encapsidation of genomic DNA being two coupled phenomena [30], we judged it reasonable to assume a generation time of 2 d and, thus, an average of ten generations during our experiments. In case this estimate is mistaken, we have verified a linear relationship between r and the number of generations, thereby allowing an immediate adjustment of r if the CaMV generation time is more precisely established. At this point, we must consider that all cloned genomes may not have been through all the successive replication events potentially allowed by the timing of our experiments. It was previously shown that about 95% of CaMV mature virus particles accumulate in compact inclusion bodies [41], where they may be sequestered for a long time, as such inclusions are very frequent in all infected cells, including those in leaves that have been invaded by the virus population for several weeks. The viral population may thus present an age structure that could bias the estimation of the recombination rate. In order to minimize this bias, the clones we analyzed were collected in one young newly formed leaf, where the chances of finding genomes from “unsequestered lines” were assumed to be higher. In any case, our data analysis is conservative, since this age structure can only lead to an underestimation of the recombination rate. Our results show that interferences between pairs of loci are negative: a recombination event between two loci apparently increases the probability of recombination between another pair of loci. We believe that the most parsimonious explanation of these negative interferences is based on the way the infection builds up within plant hosts. Indeed, one can divide infected host cells into those infected by a single virus genotype and those infected by more than one viral genotype. In the former, analogous to clonal propagation, recombination is undetectable. In the latter, recombination is not only detectable but, as our results indicate, very frequent. Samples consisting of viruses resulting from a mixture of these two types of host cell infections will thus contain viruses with no recombination and viruses with several recombination events, thus yielding an impression of negative interference. These conceptual arguments are supported by mathematical models. It is indeed easy to show (detailed results not shown) that if a proportion F of the population reproduces clonally, analogous to single infections, while the remaining reproduces panmictically, negative interferences could be inferred even if they do not exist. For example, assuming a three-locus model with real recombination rates r 1 and r 2 and interference i 12, the “apparent” recombination and interference parameters, would be r 1 = (1 − F)r1, r 2 = (1 − F)r 2, and i 12 = −(F − i 12)/(1 − F). Interestingly, this example also shows that our estimates of the recombination rate are conservative: that a fraction F of host cells are singly infected while others are multiply infected leads to an underestimation of the recombination rate. As judged by r 1, r 2, and r 3, calculated between markers a–b, b–c, and c–d, respectively, we found evidence for recombination through the entire CaMV genome. The values for r 1, r 2, and r 3 are remarkably similar, hence the recombination sites seem to be evenly distributed along the genome. We considered the template-switching model as the major way recombinants are created in CaMV. As already mentioned in the Introduction, hot spots of template switching have been predicted at the position of the 5′ extremities of the 35S and 19S RNAs [21,36,42]. If other recombination mechanisms, such as that associated with second-strand DNA synthesis or with the host cell DNA repair machinery, act significantly, hot spots would be expected at the positions of the sequence interruption Δ1, Δ2, and Δ3 [43]. Due to the design of our experiment and the position of the four markers, we have no information on putative hot spots at positions corresponding to the 5′ end of the 35S RNA and to Δ1 (at nucleotide position 0). Nevertheless, the putative hot spots at the 5′ end of the 19S RNA and at Δ2 and Δ3 (nucleotide positions 4,220 and 1,635, respectively) fall between marker pairs c–d, b–c, and a–b, respectively. Our results indicate that either these hot spots are quantitatively equivalent—though predicted by different recombination mechanisms—or, more likely, that they simply do not exist. Whatever the explanation, what we observe is that the CaMV can exchange any portion of its genome, and thus any gene thereof, with an astonishingly high frequency during the course of a single host infection. To our knowledge, the viral recombination rate has never previously been quantified experimentally for a plant virus [3]. In contrast, retroviruses and particularly HIV-1 have been extensively investigated in that sense. As we have already discussed for these latter cases, the quantification of the intrinsic recombination rate was carried out in artificially co-infected cell cultures. The estimated intrinsic per nucleotide per generation recombination rate in HIV-1 is on the order of 10−4 [14,15,19], less than one order of magnitude higher than our estimation for CaMV. Because for various reasons detailed above we probably underestimate the within-host CaMV recombination rate, we believe that the intrinsic recombination rate in CaMV is higher and perhaps on the order of that of HIV. Other pararetroviruses such as plant badnaviruses or vertebrate hepadnaviruses have a similar cycle within their host cells, including steps of nuclear minichromosome, genomic size RNA synthesis, and reverse transcription and encapsidation. Nevertheless, vertebrate hepadnaviruses (e.g., hepatitis B virus) infect hosts that are very different from plants in their biology and physiology, and this could lead to a totally different frequency of cell co-infection during the development of the virus populations. Thus, even though our results can be informative for other pararetroviruses because of the viruses' shared biological characteristics, they should not be extrapolated to vertebrate pararetroviruses without caution. | Viral isolates ::: ::: Materials and Methods: We used the plasmid pCa37, which is the complete genome of the CaMV isolate Cabb-S, cloned into the pBR322 plasmid at the unique SalI restriction site [44]. To analyze recombination in different regions of the genome, we introduced four genetic markers: a, b, c, and d, at the positions 881, 3,539, 5,365, and 6,943, respectively, thus approximately at four cardinal points of the CaMV circular double-stranded DNA of 8,024 bp (Figure 1). All markers, each corresponding to a single nucleotide change, were introduced by PCR-directed mutagenesis in pCa37, and resulted in the duplication of previously unique restriction sites BsiWI, PstI, MluI, and SacI in a plasmid designated pMark-S. Because, in this study, we targeted the possible exchange of genes between viral genomes, all markers a, b, c, and d were introduced within coding regions corresponding to open reading frames I, IV, V, and VI, respectively. Another important concern was to quantify recombination in the absence of selection, i.e., to create neutral markers. Consequently all markers consist of synonymous mutations (see below). | Production of viral particles and co-inoculation ::: ::: Materials and Methods: To generate the parental virus particles, plasmids pCa37 and pMark-S were mechanically inoculated into individual plants as previously described [33]. All plants were turnips (B. rapa cv, “Just Right”) grown under glasshouse conditions at 23 °C with a 16/8 (light/dark) photoperiod. Thirty days post-inoculation, all symptomatic leaves were harvested and viral particles were purified as described earlier [45]. The resulting preparations of parental viruses, designated Cabb-S and Mark-S, were quantified by spectrometry using the formula described by Hull et al. [46]. We fixed the initial frequency of markers to a value of 0.5, and a solution containing 0.1 mg/ml of virus particles of both Cabb-S and Mark-S at a 1:1 ratio was prepared. Plantlets were co-infected by mechanical inoculation of two to three leaves with 20 μl of this virus solution, using abrasive Celite AFA (Fluka, Ronkonkoma, New York, United States). The mixed CaMV population was allowed to grow during 21 d of systemic infection. | Estimation of marker frequency within mixed virus populations ::: ::: Materials and Methods: We designed an experimental protocol for quantifying marker frequency within a mixed Cabb-S/Mark-S virus population after a single passage in a host plant. Twenty-four individual plants, inoculated as above with equal amounts of Cabb-S and Mark-S, were harvested 21 d post-inoculation, when symptoms were fully developed. The viral DNA was purified from 200 mg of young newly formed infected leaves according to the protocol described previously [47]. After the precipitation step of this protocol, the viral DNA was resuspended and further purified with the Wizard DNA clean-up kit (Promega, Fitchburg, Wisconsin, United States) in TE 1X (100 mM Tris-HCl and 10 mM EDTA [pH 8]). Aliquots of viral DNA preparations were digested by restriction enzymes corresponding either to marker a, b, c, or d and submitted to a 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, colored by ethydium bromide and exposed to UV. Each individual restriction enzyme cut once in Cabb-S DNA and twice in Mark-S, thus generating DNA fragments of different sizes attributable to one or the other in the mixed population of CaMV genomes. After scanning the agarose gels, we estimated the relative frequency of the two genotypes in each viral DNA preparation and at each marker position, by densitometry using the NIH 1.62 Image program. The statistical analyses of the frequency of the four markers are described below. | Isolation of individual CaMV genomes and identification of recombinants ::: ::: Materials and Methods: To identify and quantify the recombinants within the CaMV mixed populations, aliquots from ten of the 24 viral DNA preparations described above were digested by the restriction enzyme SalI, and directly cloned into pUC19 at the corresponding site. In each of the ten viral populations analyzed, 50 full-genome-length clones were digested separately by BsiWI, PstI, MluI, and SacI, to test for the presence of marker a, b, c, and d, respectively. In this experiment, with the marker representing an additional restriction site, we could easily distinguish between the Cabb-S and the Mark-S genotype at all four marker positions, upon agarose gel (1%) electrophoresis of the digested clones. Clones with none or all four markers were parental genotypes, whereas clones harboring 1, 2, or 3 markers were clearly recombinants. Due to the very high number of recombinants detected, markers eventually appearing or disappearing due to spontaneous mutations were neglected. | Statistical analysis ::: ::: Materials and Methods: Here we present the different methods we used to quantify recombination in the CaMV genome. Because all these methods assume that the different markers are neutral, we first discuss assumption. We used two datasets to test the neutrality of markers, both resulting from plants co-infected with a 1:1 ratio of Mark-S and Cabb-S. The first consisted of viral DNA densitometry data derived from 24 plants (described above), where for each plant we have an estimate of the frequency of each marker in the genome population. The second consisted of the restriction of 50 individual full-genome-length viral clones obtained from one co-infected plant (described above), yielding an estimate of the frequency of each marker, and this was repeated on ten different plants. The frequencies of the different markers were 0.508, 0.501, 0.516, and 0.507 for markers a, b, c, and d in the first dataset and 0.521, 0.518, 0.514, and 0.524 in the second dataset. We tested whether these frequencies were significantly different from the expected value under neutrality, 0.5, using either t-tests, for datasets where normality could not be rejected (seven out of eight cases), or Wilcoxon signed-rank non-parametric tests otherwise (marker c in the first dataset). In all cases p-values were larger than 0.05. There are several cautionary remarks regarding these analyses. First, in all cases we found an excess of markers. Unfortunately, the two datasets cannot be regarded as independent because, even though the methods through which the frequency estimates were obtained were different, the plants used in the second dataset were a subset of the plants of the first. We thus have only four independent estimates in each case, and there is minimal power to detect significant deviations from neutrality with such a small sample size. It should be noted at this stage that deviations from the expected value could also be caused either by slight deviations from the 1:1 ratio in the infecting mixed solution, or by deviations from that ratio in the frequency of the viral particles that actually get into the plants. Second, because of the relatively small sample sizes and low statistical power, the tests presented above could have detected only large deviations. The results clearly show, however, precisely that the markers do not have large effects, if any, and that therefore recombination estimates would be affected only very slightly by any hypothetical selective effects of the markers. Because of this, along with the fact that the introduced markers provoke silent substitutions in the CaMV genome, we assumed that markers were effectively neutral in the rest of the analysis. The dataset used to estimate the recombination frequency consisted of the 500 full-genome-length viral clones (50 from each of ten co-infected plants) individually genotyped for each of the four markers. As discussed in detail in the Results, recombination was very frequent and concerned all four markers. Indeed, approximately half of the genotyped clones exhibited a recombinant genotype. It was therefore meaningful to try to obtain quantitative estimates of recombination from our data. Our aim was to analyze viral recombination in a live host. Consequently, we had to deal with the fact that more than one viral replication cycle occurred during the 21 d that infection lasted in our experiment (we had to wait that long for the disease to develop and to be able to recover sufficient amounts of viral DNA from each infection). Based on the kinetics of gene expression [40], we postulate that each replication cycle lasts between 2 and 3 d, and that therefore seven to ten cycles occurred between infection and the sampling time. In case this assumption is incorrect, we did calculations assuming five, seven, ten, or 20 replication cycles during these 21 d. As shown, the results were not affected qualitatively, and only slightly quantitatively. It is important to note that we assumed that recombination occurred through a template-switching mechanism, and that therefore, from a recombination point of view, the CaMV genome is linear. The reverse transcription starts and finishes at the position 0 in Figure 1, which is the point of circularization of the DNA genome. This implies that changes between contiguous markers a–b, b–c, and c–d can be considered as true recombination whereas those between a and d cannot, as they may simply stem from circularization of DNA, during the synthesis of which the polymerase has switched template once anywhere between a–b, b–c, or c–d. To estimate the recombination rate between markers, we wrote recurrence equations describing the change in frequency of each genotype over one generation, assuming random mating and no selection (i.e., the standard Wright–Fisher population genetics model). We then expressed the frequency of all possible genotypes n generations later as a function of their initial frequency and of the recombination parameters. Subsequently we calculated the maximum likelihood estimates of the recombination parameters and their asymptotic variances given initial frequencies (we assumed that the two “parental” genotypes, Mark-S and Cabb-S, had equal initial frequencies of 0.5 and that all other genotypes had initial frequencies of zero) and frequencies after n generations (the observed frequencies; as stated above we used different values of n). All algebraic and numerical calculations were carried out with the software Mathematica. The recombination parameters are the recombination rates between two adjacent loci, e.g., r 1 for the recombination rate between markers a and b, and the interference coefficients, e.g., i 12 for interference between recombination events in the segments between markers a and b and b and c. To define these parameters we followed Christiansen [48], and in particular the recombination distributions for two, three, and four loci (respectively, Tables 2.7, 2.8, and 2.9 of [48]). It is important to realize that given the definitions of these parameters, the estimator of the recombination rate between two loci is not affected by the number of loci considered. In other words, we obtain the same estimation of the recombination rate between markers a and b whether we consider genotypic frequencies at just these two loci, or the frequencies at these two loci plus a third locus, or the complete information to which we have access, the four-marker genotypes. Information on additional loci only affects the estimates of the interference coefficients. It proved impossible to carry out the calculations for four loci algebraically. Instead, we used a computer program to calculate the expected genotypic frequencies at all four loci after n generations, given the above stated initial frequencies and specified recombination parameters. For each combination of recombination parameters we calculated a Euclidean distance between the vector of the expected genotypic frequencies and the observed genotypic frequencies, and considered that the estimated recombination parameters were those yielding the minimal Euclidean distance. In all cases, the estimated recombination rates between pairs of loci were equal to the second decimal to those estimated algebraically from data for three or two loci.

PMC1065028	Why can't I visit? The ethics of visitation restrictions – lessons learned from SARS		Introduction: The sudden emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in April 2003 caused much concern and reaction. Refereed medical journals ever since have been rife with articles about SARS. The eventual containment and treatment of SARS has seen a diminution of the massive media publicity and overt public concern. However, fears have recently surfaced about the potential for re-emergence of SARS in the near future. As we confront the potential need to return to more stringent infection control measures once again, this is an appropriate time to reflect on the ethical values that underlay the strict visitation restrictions imposed in hospitals in Ontario during the SARS outbreak and the moderate restrictions in place since SARS. This reflection will facilitate future decision making with respect to visitation restrictions. | When public health trumps civil liberties: the collateral damage associated with victims of SARS: Our infectious disease colleagues are adamant that restricting the movement of people into and around the hospital setting are effective clinical and epidemiological strategies that will help protect both the vulnerable patient population and health care providers themselves, who need to stay healthy so that they may care for their patients. One might argue, then, that visitation restrictions are both enhancing and supportive of public health protection. This position recognizes that there are times when public health protection overrides the protection of individual freedom. It could be argued that visitation restrictions, in light of a potential outbreak of a contagious disease, are ethically sound because of the compelling need to protect public health. However, even when public health concerns trump individual liberties, the ethical operationalization of this value would demand that 'those whose rights are being infringed' need to be managed in 'an ethical and even-handed manner so that they are not unfairly or disproportionately harmed by such measures' [1]. This is an important and far-reaching consideration because SARS caused collateral damage and we know that the implementation of visitation restrictions will have an impact on a broad range of individuals. Understandably, those patients who were confirmed or suspected of being carriers of contagious pathogens were easily and directly identified. However, there were people who had not demonstrated any risk or epidemiological link to a contagious disease but who experienced quarantine, restriction of movement, inconvenience, loss of pay, and inability to access important and sometimes vital services within the health care system. In fact, there was a general trend within the populace toward avoiding meetings/gatherings, as well as kissing, hugging and even hand shaking. Clearly, these restrictions are reflective of a loss of civil liberties in the general population and render expressions of caring difficult at a time when people may need them the most. In a health care institution, visitation restrictions not only affect inpatients but also have an impact on ambulatory patients who must come for diagnostic tests or interventions and who, if deprived access, might develop urgent or emergent conditions. Restrictions are likely to cause distress, anxiety and increased complaints. In fact, on review of the University Health Network corporate complaint database, SARS 1 (period March 28–April 20, 2003) and SARS 2 (period May 12–August 10, 2003) generated a 27% increase in complaints over the expected number of complaints for that time period. Specifically, during this time period there would normally have been 770 calls of complaint, but with SARS 1 and 2 a total of 1052 calls of complaint were received. It should be stressed that these data are over and above the complaints received at each site of the corporation, which were not captured in the database. Ultimately, this is a set of problems that must be managed with sensitivity and clarity (Nyhof-Young and colleagues, unpublished data). In view of the magnitude of implications of visitor restriction, it is important that policy decisions, at the micro or macro level, consider issues of equity, publicity, transparency and the appeal process. Issues of equity must take into consideration the known facts from a scientific perspective as well as the range of approaches considered. In terms of transparency and due diligence, the rationale behind the policies and how they will be implemented should be as clear and unambiguous as possible. Feedback should be sought from those individuals who would be affected by visitation restrictions, such as staff, patients and family members. The policy must be made accessible, printed and broadly circulated throughout the hospital so that people understand the rules, the rationale for those rules, the processes available to them to assist them in 'living with those rules' and ways to appeal in special circumstances. Visitation policy developers must realize that there may be exceptional circumstances that demand exceptional latitude. The development of criteria for exceptionality must recognize the need for proportionality, ensuring that criteria are 'relevant, legitimate and necessary ... and should be applied without discrimination' [1]. Furthermore, to be consistent with expectations of transparency, the criteria by which exceptionality to the rules of visitation restriction exists should also be published openly throughout the organization for staff, patients and visitors. From our experience with SARS, a corporate policy was developed and there was an expectation that there would be compliance with this corporate policy. However, it was also acknowledged that local patient needs would dictate more or less stringent adherence to these rules, and that the degree of adherence might change quickly without the opportunity for broad notification. For example, although current policy allows for specific times of visitation and numbers of visitors per day, a sudden outbreak might dictate a quick lockdown of the facility without patients or family members receiving prior notice. | Health care workers' duty to care and the duty of institutions to support them: A health care professional has a duty to care, based on several ethical considerations [1] such as professional code of conduct, intrinsic requirements of the work and the acceptance of risk as part of the decision to do a specific type of work. Part of this duty to care for patients encompasses a broader duty, in that one must care for their family as well. Visitation restrictions impede this ability because health care providers find themselves in the awkward position of conveying very private, personal messages between patients and family members, of providing updates and of breaking bad news over the phone, thus losing their ability to convey empathy or judge the amount of support required effectively. Moreover, health care workers, being in direct communication with patients and families, bear the brunt of their anger and frustration regarding any restriction in visitation. There is an implicit acceptance that reciprocity exists between the hospital organization and the individual staff member [1]. To this end, it is the organization that must accept responsibility for making rules and communicating them broadly to all staff, patients and visitors. Similarly, it is the responsibility of the organization to enforce compliance with these rules; it is not the responsibility of staff, whose primary responsibility is to discharge the duty of care to the patient. The organization also has the responsibility of developing a set of criteria outlining exceptionality and a process to receive, review and adjudicate requests. A process must be developed (together with appropriate resources) so that staff members know who to access for support and are able to do this is in an easy and expeditious manner. | Naming names, naming communities: privacy of personal information and public need to know: In the interests of the public good, there may be times when information must be shared publicly, thereby impinging on the rights of the individual to privacy and confidentiality. With respect to restricted visitation, an ethical argument could be made that visitation restrictions (or latitude thereof) can be instituted generally, without specifically naming names. Although the vigilant observer might be able to identify a specific person from a changed application of the rule, the organization cannot reasonably be expected to guard against every possible identification, but every effort should be made to protect the individual from easy identification. For example, if a family is allowed to visit a patient whose death is presumed to be imminent (within the next 24 hours), then the patient's identity should be protected by using privacy strategies. Efforts to protect the patient's identity are consistent with the ethical value of 'protection of communities from undue stigmatization' [1]. | SARS in a globalized world: Given the risks associated with contagious pathogens and the easy mode of transmission globally, it is important that there be consistency in management. The ideal situation would be a consistent global approach to the management of each and every contagious pathogen. The notion of universal management strategies is very sensible (e.g. universal precautions with blood-borne conditions such HIV). However, given the political and economic disparities across the world as well as the lack of knowledge (particularly of newly evolving pathogens), a standardized approach is not possible. The experience of SARS indicates that some patient populations require a level of vigilance that is more stringent than that required in others. For example, those individuals who reported recent travel to high risk areas, and those who worked in quarantined or contaminated hospitals or who exhibited clear symptoms (e.g. fever, persistent cough) were scrutinized with more vigilance and were in fact treated differently than other visitors, until they were cleared through the screening process. This type of variability in vigilance demands ethical management of differences, and there is a need to guard against overt bias or discrimination creeping into the process. It is difficult to expect that both standardization of approach and variability in approach can easily coexist, but the operational challenge is to exercise awareness of the ethical values discussed above and the appropriate due diligence in the implementation of processes. | Conclusion: It is ethical to accept that public health protection trumps individual rights to liberal visitation. The rationale for this position must be fully outlined to patients, visitors and staff. In responding to visitors who may be deprived of visitation, it is ethical to recognize that there may be exceptional circumstances that demand exceptional latitude. A set of criteria outlining exceptionality should be developed, as should a process to receive, review and adjudicate requests. In the interests of equity, an appeal process should be made explicit and transparent to all. This information should be well publicized to staff, patients and visitors in a consistent and sensitive manner. Every reasonable effort should be made to protect the individual patient's identity and their specific health status should exceptionality be considered. It is ethically the responsibility of the organization to enforce compliance with restricted visitation and a corporate department should be assigned this task. Although it is recognized that standardization in the application of visitation restrictions is necessary, there is recognition that there may be circumstances that would require deviation from the corporate position. | Competing interests: The author has declared no competing interests. | Abbreviations: SARS = severe acute respiratory syndrome	Sharon Rogers		PMC1065028	pmc
PMC1065064	Prospective evaluation of an internet-linked handheld computer critical care knowledge access system		Introduction: The rate of expansion of medical knowledge is increasing rapidly, and it is frequently difficult for clinicians to keep abreast of important new literature. For example, several recently published randomized controlled trials in critical care have demonstrated mortality benefits [1-5], but uptake of new knowledge into clinical practice is often delayed [6-8]. Improving access to this knowledge base at the point of care may lead to better clinical decision making, which could improve patient outcome, reduce costs and optimize bed utilization [9]. In critical care, rapid access to medical reference information may be particularly important in facilitating timely management decisions and avoiding errors [10]. Computing technology can allow point-of-care access to up-to-date medical reference material [11]. A study evaluating a mobile computerized cart to make evidence available to clinicians in an internal medicine setting [12] demonstrated that evidence-based medicine was more likely to be incorporated into patient care when the computerized system was used. Because of their portability, handheld devices may be more practical tools for disseminating knowledge to the point of care. Despite the popularity of handheld devices in medicine, few studies have evaluated the usefulness of this technology [13]. Before widespread dissemination of this type of technology can be encouraged, its impact must be thoroughly evaluated [14]. In the present study we evaluated whether it would be feasible and effective to provide updateable reference information from a central academic centre to handheld computers used by critical care specialists in community hospitals. | Study design, participants and setting ::: Methods: A total of 17 intensivists at four community hospital intensive care units (ICUs) in the Greater Toronto Area participated in the present prospective interventional study. | Intervention ::: Methods: After training, each physician was equipped with a handheld computing device (Palm M505; Palm Inc., Milpitas, CA, USA) loaded with medical reference material pertinent to the critical care physician. This information included a customized critical care information handbook ('Critical Care'), which was previously developed for use by residents and physicians at our centre (Additional file 1). Commercially available medical reference software was also incorporated, namely PEPID ED (PEPID LLC, Skokie, IL, USA) and MedCalc . The handheld devices were able to receive literature updates on a regular basis, using customized software (IqSync; Infiniq Software, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), which accessed an internet-based server using either a connection via desktop computer or infrared data transfer to a telephone modem (Fig. 1). New information was sent to the handheld devices and appeared in a file called 'What's New'. These updates, provided every 2–3 weeks, comprised brief reviews of relevant new literature including a short summary, a commentary and the article abstract. All handheld devices were equipped with backup software that allowed the content to be rapidly restored in the event of a hardware failure (BackupBuddy VFS; Blue Nomad Software, Redwood City, CA, USA). The devices were also equipped with software capable of generating a log of the applications used (AppUsage; Benc Software Production, Slavonski Brod, Croatia). Between September and November 2002 the handheld devices were distributed to participating physicians, at which time they each received a 1-hour training session on the use of the handheld device and the internet link (Fig. 2). After training, the participants were able to utilize the devices in clinical practice for 12 months. We provided 24-hour support by telephone and e-mail, with a website for independent review. | Feasibility ::: Outcome measures ::: Methods: Feasibility of the system was assessed by tracking physicians' use of the handheld device and tracking their access of the individual handheld applications during the study period. Physicians who updated their handheld computers at least once a month for 6 months were identified as 'regular users'. A qualitative assessment of the system was achieved through surveys and focus group methodology. Participants completed surveys at baseline to identify their prior familiarity with handheld devices, and at the end of the study period to evaluate subjectively the handheld reference system and the individual handheld applications. Survey data were scored on a 7-point scale, in which 'poor' scored 1 and 'excellent' scored 7. An independent company (The NRC+Picker Group, Markham, Canada) conducted the focus group evaluations at the end of the intervention period, to determine the perceived utility of the information system. Each hospital physician group participated in one focus group meeting. | Information access ::: Outcome measures ::: Methods: Information sources that physicians accessed to make clinical decisions were evaluated during simulated patient care scenarios, completed in the physicians' own ICU utilizing a computerized patient simulator (SimMan; Laerdal Medical Corporation, Wappingers Falls, NY, USA). Each physician completed one scenario before the handheld device was introduced (baseline scenario) and one at the end of the intervention period (final scenario), when the handheld device could be used (Fig. 2). A small pool of five scenarios with equivalent complexity was developed, such that physicians would likely need to access information sources in order to make management decisions. The scenarios involved unusual but important conditions, namely thyroid storm, myasthenia gravis, methanol toxicity, malaria and methemoglobinaemia. They were allocated to study participants in such a way as to avoid participants from the same site receiving the same scenario at the same time point, and to avoid repetition of scenarios among individual participants. Each scenario concluded with the physician writing admission orders for the simulated patient. During the scenarios we tracked all medical reference sources utilized by the physicians, who were encouraged to use a 'think aloud' process [15]. An audiovisual recording was made of the scenarios for later analysis, and when the handheld was used real-time screen capture was incorporated into the recording (Additional file 2). This allowed us to document which handheld applications were accessed, the time taken to access information and the time taken to complete the scenario. We developed an objective scoring system for the admission orders generated at each scenario. The admission orders were assigned a score (range 0–100) by a critical care physician (SM) and critical care pharmacist (LB), who were blinded as to whether the physician used the handheld device. The scenario-specific scoring system allocated points for all necessary diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, weighted according to relative importance. Negative points were given for potentially harmful orders. | Data analysis ::: Methods: Data are presented as median and interquartile range (IQR), and permutation tests were used for comparisons because numbers were small and not normally distributed. The differences between the final and baseline admission order scores and the time to completion of scenarios were calculated for each participant. A two-sample permutation test was used to compare these differences between the group of physicians who chose to use the handheld in the final scenario and those who did not use the device. Admission order scores obtained for each of the five scenarios were compared. Outcomes were considered statistically significant at α < 0.05. The SAS System for Window version 8.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used for all analyses. Focus groups were recorded, transcribed verbatim and subsequently analyzed. Themes were identified and unique perspectives on key issues noted [16]. | Feasibility ::: Results: The handheld information system functioned well during the study period. Tracking of the deployment of handhelds identified 10 regular users (59%), four physicians (23%) who used the system variably and three physicians (18%) who never used their handheld device. The regular users accessed the personal information management applications more commonly (median 32.8 times/month, IQR 28.3–126.8) than the medical software (median 9/month, IQR 3.7–13.7; P = 0.028), although significant variation was noted (Table 1). Baseline survey data identified that, of the 17 critical care physicians participating, 12 (71%) had previous experience with handheld devices (nine had used the Palm operating system, and three had used Windows CE) for a median duration of 1 year (range 1 month to 3.8 years). Seven participants (41%) reported using handhelds for accessing medical information before the study. Of the 16 final survey respondents, seven (44%) felt that the handheld system had had a positive impact on their clinical practice. The handheld medical applications (Critical Care, What's New, Medcalc and PEPID) received similar ratings, with overall evaluation scores ranging from 4.1 to 5.3 on the 7-point scale. Four focus group meetings, involving a total of 13 participants (76%), identified the benefits and barriers to use of handhelds for information access, and made suggestions for improvement (Table 2). The overall impression of participants was that there is a role for handhelds for mobile information access, but that in situations away from the bedside other electronic media such as desktop computers were preferable. | Information access ::: Results: Not all study physicians were able to participate in the simulated clinical scenarios on the pre-assigned day. Fourteen physicians (82.3%) participated in the baseline scenarios and 13 (76.5%) in the final scenarios. Information sources utilized during the baseline scenarios included the internet (50% of participants; e.g. Medline searches and electronic textbooks), textbooks (43%), telephoning colleagues, the ICU pharmacist or Poison Control Centre (71%), and other sources such as pocket guides (21%). In the final scenarios, the handheld device was used as the primary source of information by eight participants (62%; Table 3). Of 14 information searches on the handheld device, 11 searches (79%) were successful and the median time to access information was 19 s (IQR 15–40 s). The information sources of those participants not using the handheld device were similar to those in the baseline surveys (Table 3). Analysis of the time to completion of the clinical scenarios demonstrated no significant difference between those physicians who used the handheld and those who did not (12.92 min, IQR 10.73–16.62 min versus 15.5 min, IQR 12.85–22.72 min, respectively). Physicians who did not use their handheld device in the final clinical scenarios had similar scores to their baseline scenario scores (median 60.0, IQR 40.0–60.0 versus 58.0, IQR 44.5–70.5, respectively). In contrast, an improvement in the final scenario score as compared with the baseline score was noted for those participants who chose to use the handheld device (median 66.0, IQR 52.5–74.5 versus 44.8, IQR 30.5–54.5, respectively; P = 0.018; Fig. 3). When scores recorded for each of the five clinical scenarios were compared, no significant difference was noted, reducing the likelihood that scenario assignment influenced outcomes. | Discussion: This study demonstrates the feasibility of using an electronic knowledge translation system to provide high quality, regularly updated medical reference information from a central academic centre to multiple peripheral users. User acceptance of this technology was not uniform, with just over half of the participants using their handheld devices to access information on a regular basis. Nevertheless, the availability of point-of-care access to information may have improved the quality of clinical decision-making. Although mobile computing devices have potential beneficial roles to play in clinical medicine, few publications describe formal evaluation of this technology [13]. Because the present study was an early hypothesis-generating evaluation of this technology, multiple quantitative and qualitative outcomes were measured. We generated novel data on the use of handheld devices in a clinical situation, but the study has several limitations. The number of physicians involved was relatively small, with a significant proportion not utilizing the technology. The allocation of clinical scenarios was not randomized, because they were allocated predominantly to avoid using the same scenario at the same site and time point. However, the analysis performed compared participants who used the handheld with those who did not; because it was not known which participant would use the handheld at the time of allocation of scenarios, potential bias was minimized. Furthermore, the scenarios appeared to be equivalent in difficulty because no difference was noted when scores for the individual scenarios were compared. A confounding factor in the study was the outbreak of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) from March to May 2003, which had a significant impact on the study ICUs [17]. Participants were advised to avoid using their handhelds during patient contact because of the potential to transmit infection, and this affected continuity of the study. Had we not encountered this event, utilization might have been higher. The lack of universal acceptance of this technology is not surprising and may be due to a number of factors, including inadequate training and the lack of familiarity with the technology [18]. Training is essential when introducing handheld computing technology [19,20] and, although all users underwent a training programme, the surveys and focus groups indicated a need for improvement. Familiarity with handhelds is increasing, with 33% of all Canadian physicians and 53% of under 35-year-olds using these devices in 2003, but these levels of utilization remain relatively low when compared with use of the internet, at 88% [21]. Increasing familiarity with the technology will probably increase acceptance of such a system. Other potential barriers to use of the handheld system may be addressed by the rapidly developing technology, including improved screen resolution, ease of data entry and wireless connectivity. Acceptance may be increased through the development of an all-in-one package on the handheld, allowing additional functionality such as decision support, billing, electronic prescribing and communication. The study demonstrated the potential role of an updateable handheld information system for knowledge translation in critical care. Rapid access to current clinical guidelines may be a valuable component of a comprehensive solution to reducing error and improving efficiency. Information access may be most beneficial in areas without full-time critical care physicians, particularly given the current imbalance between demand and supply with critical care physicians, which is expected to worsen [9,10]. Recent recommendations highlight the importance of leveraging information technology to standardize practice and promote efficiency in critical care [10]. Handheld information access alone is unlikely to change clinical practice, but it should be considered a component of an electronic knowledge translation system. In many situations other media, such as desktop or tablet computers, may be preferable for information access. Although the study was carried out in a critical care environment, such a system is probably applicable to other specialties in which clinicians are mobile and may not have ready access to a desktop computer (for example, anaesthesia, emergency medicine, home care). This study provides insight into the potential impact of this technology in improving health care outcomes [14]. Nevertheless, further study that builds on our findings is essential to determine how these new technologies can best be incorporated into the patient care setting. | Conclusion: A handheld computer system is feasible as a means of providing point-of-care access to medical reference material in the ICU. During this study acceptance of this system was variable, and improved training and more advanced technology may be required to overcome some of the barriers we identified. In clinical simulations, use of such a system appeared to improve clinical decision-making. | Key messages: • This study demonstrated that an updateable handheld computer information resource is a feasible means for providing point-of-care access to medical reference information in the ICU. • Acceptance of this system was variable and may be improved by enhanced training and newer technological innovations. • In clinical simulations, this system appeared to improve clinical decision making. | Competing interests: The author(s) declare that they have no competing intrests. | Author contributions: Stephen Lapinsky, Randy Wax and Thomas Stewart were responsible for study design.

PMC1065120	Scanning the horizon: emerging hospital-wide technologies and their impact on critical care		Introduction: This series of articles provides regular surveillance of new technologies which may impact on critical care. Several countries have developed national horizon scanning systems to identify and monitor new health technologies. There is variation in how these centres gather information, but a consistent set of high priority sources has been identified [1]. For the purposes of this article, the outputs of major health technology assessment centres, national regulatory authorities, and recognized scientific news sources (Table 1) were systematically searched for developments relevant to acute and critical care. This was combined with a manual medical literature search, along key editorial themes subjectively selected for this issue. | Point-of-care diagnostics and ultra-rapid laboratory testing: Point-of-care testing is a major emerging theme throughout the health sector, encompassing both new diagnoses and monitoring of known diseases and their treatment. Areas of research range from the potentially lucrative markets for outpatient, 'office'-based and patient self-testing, through to in-hospital diagnostics, which include both rapid access analysis of traditionally laboratory bound diagnostics and direct patient imaging. Both aspects are particularly relevant to critical care clinicians, who rely on time sensitive diagnosis and treatment in a hyper-acute setting. An example of bedside imaging in cardiac assessment has already been cited in the first article of the present series [2]. Sample analysis, meanwhile, is rapidly developing to encompass bedside biochemical markers, physiological homeostasis monitoring, and novel ultra-rapid forms of infectious disease diagnosis. B-type natriuretic peptide can be a rapid and effective marker of ventricular strain and heart failure [3], and can now be measured using a point-of-care diagnostic panel (Triage BNP Test; Biosite Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Similar current and forthcoming technologies include rapid access D-dimer assays for diagnosis of pulmonary embolism as part of a structured point-of-care algorithm [4] and unpublished early developments in stroke diagnostics. Validation and clinical trials of these technologies have taken place primarily in the emergency department setting, but heart failure, cerebrovascular accident and pulmonary embolism are all of added significance in the intensive care unit (ICU) as both primary and acquired conditions. Rapid bedside diagnosis of such conditions with minimal need for intrahospital transport may be of great potential benefit to intensivists. The importance of tight glucose control in sepsis is becoming well established [5], although work continues on refining the target range, with a study of 4,000 patients now in progress (Normoglycaemia in Intensive CarE study, ANZICS, commencing 2004). The first major prospective study of tight glucose control in sepsis introduced a novel algorithm requiring frequent measurements [6], which raised concerns over patient safety and resource utilization in general ICUs. Point-of-care 'stick' glucose testing is already prevalent, but technology now exists for continuous in vivo glucose monitoring, which, although intended for ambulatory use, could improve accuracy in the acute setting. A subcutaneous interstitial glucose sensor system (Continuous Glucose Monitoring System; Medtronic MiniMed, Inc., Northridge, CA, USA) was tested against clamp controlled hypoglycaemic and hyperglycaemic excursions in volunteers [7]; it was shown to be closely correlated with reference analyzer results (r2 = 0.91; P < 0.001) and highly responsive (half-time 4.0 ± 1.0 min). Similarly, another device (Glucoday; A. Menarini Diagnostics, Florence, Italy), utilizing a 15–100 μl micropump and a biosensor coupled with microdialysis to give a claimed response time of 2 min, will reach European markets this year. Such devices may be incorporated into manual algorithms, or they may potentially open the way to automated closed-loop glucose control. Microbiological diagnosis within clinical laboratories has been advancing apace [8]. Polymerase chain reaction technology is well established, but progressive refinements have made possible the rapid and near real-time diagnosis of current, novel, or newly relevant pathogens, including HIV and SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). Techniques initially aimed at viruses because of their manageable size can now also be applied to bacteria and can be used for broad, simultaneous screening of multiple pathogens (Pneumoplex, Prodesse, Milwaukee, WI, USA). Further refinements in microarrays and microfluidics are anticipated to bring handhand and point-of-care systems into use in the near future. Point-of-care and rapid laboratory based technologies will soon be able to elicit not only pathogen identity but also patterns of drug resistance. Developments include the use of adenylate kinase assay for accelerated laboratory based identification of drug-resistant bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (BacLite, Acolyte Biomedica, Salisbury, UK; ). Point-of-care testing within emergency and critical care areas is likely to develop rapidly in the next 5 years, but it will bring complications relating to quality control, medicolegal liability, certificated training for ICU and other nonlaboratory staff, increased cost, and territoriality issues. Finally, other bedside technologies that have recently been assessed include the use of handheld ultrasound devices to detect occult pneumothoraces, which have been shown to have a higher sensitivity than chest radiography (48.8% versus 20.9%) against a computed tomography standard [9]. Preliminary investigations suggest that handheld infrared pupillometry may be of clinical use in detecting midline cerebral shift in head injury patients [10]. More procedure orientated assistance may become available from near-infrared technology, which has been piloted in a computerized bedside visualization device to aid venous cannulation [11]. Applicability to central venous cannulation has not been explored. | Infection and sepsis: Acquired bloodstream infection (BSI) in the ICU is a serious complication. A study of ICU patients in Calgary [12] demonstrated crude death rates of 45% among patients with ICU-acquired BSI, as compared with 21% in those without (P < 0.0001). S aureus was isolated in 18% of cases in the study cited above. In this context, the development of an antistaphylococcal vaccine (StaphVAX; Nabi Pharmaceuticals, Boca Raton, FL, USA) represents a promising new health technology [13]. StaphVAX is currently in phase III trials for end-stage renal disease, but phase II trials are under way in postoperative and long hospital stay patients. Health technology assessment encompasses the best use of current health care devices as well as emerging technologies. Medical devices represent a prime infection hazard, and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines [14] cover the safe use of intravascular devices to minimize acquired BSI. However more recent work demonstrates that the incidence of catheter-related BSI may be significantly reduced by adding a further device – needle-free, disinfectable connectors instead of three-way stopcocks – to the existing recommendations (0.7 infections/1000 days versus 5.0 infections/1000 days of catheter use; P < 0.03) [15]. Clinical management of sepsis is normally outside the remit of this section of the journal. However, it is noteworthy that new mechanical technology has been applied to the direct treatment of sepsis rather than to cardiovascular or tissue perfusion monitoring. A recent European multicentre open randomized phase II trial [16] investigated the use of the Endotoxin Adsorber system EN500 (Fresenius, Bad Homburg, Germany) in 145 patients with severe sepsis or septic shock due to suspected Gram-negative infection. The study demonstrated a trend toward reduced ICU stay and more rapid reduction in lipopolysaccharide levels, but it failed to show any difference in outcome. | Information technology: Certain developments in this sector are pertinent to critical care. ISABEL is a web-based, diagnostic decision support tool intended to provide diagnosis reminders and minimize missed diagnosis of critical disease processes. It is currently in use in several UK and overseas hospitals, with development supported by UK Department of Health funding followed by a commercial launch [17]. The methodology is novel; a commercial artificial intelligence inference engine (Autonomy, Cambridge, UK) is used to extract and structure information from standard paediatric textbooks, and to generate diagnostic reminders from this knowledge base in response to unstructured free text clinical information. The software has been under development for some time and was reviewed in this journal in 2002 [18], but it is now being modified to encompass adult critical illness. A review of decision support systems by the UK National Institute of Clinical Excellence is pending. There are political and medicolegal implications. The ISABEL project was initially set up on a charitable basis by the parents of a child who survived a prolonged stay in paediatric intensive care after a missed diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis. Although the system is as yet little known among adult intensivists, its technology is innovative and its proposed status as an 'online second opinion' may give it, together with similar expert systems, a powerful consumerist resonance with patients, carers and managers. The UK National Institute of Clinical Excellence findings should be monitored with interest by critical care providers. More broadly, the UK health service is currently in the grip of a globally unprecedented large-scale National Project for IT (NPfIT) [19]. Structured as a series of private finance initiatives, this ambitious programme will ultimately see in a host of regionally standardized patient information systems, image storage, and networked monitoring and audit systems, linked to a national electronic patient record 'spine'. There are already concerns about timescale, feasibility and funding. Broader concern is growing about catastrophic and unpredictable 'emergent behaviour' in massively interconnected information technology (IT) systems, which are rapidly becoming too complex to test or accurately model [20]. Emergent behaviour in complex systems has already been explored in popular fictional media, in which predicted outcomes are spectacular but somewhat discouraging [21]; however, even without quite such an apocalyptic scenario, we may well see a rising incidence of total system failures due to unpredictable nonlinear behaviour – that is, major collapses triggered by small unforeseen causes. In the light of recent North American power outages and destructive computer failures in the UK social service and tax systems, emergent behavour must now be considered a clear and present threat to our increasingly networked health services and their supporting infrastructure. Levels of concern are such that the UK Government is funding a £10 million research programme into IT complexity and catastrophic failures. How much of this is relevant to critical care or to other countries? First, ICUs provide complex, time-sensitive care to highly dependent patients. They therefore require the successful convergence of multiple hospital systems, which makes them uniquely vulnerable to the consequences of system failures, whether in diagnostics, supplies, information flow, or indeed electrical power. Second, the currently stated UK NPfIT vision is that all ICU subsystems, including networked monitoring, telemetry and audit systems, will eventually be integrated into NPfIT, with control over equipment selection and data collection handed to the regional private sector consortia and to national audit bodies. Clinician engagement and choice may not feature highly on the agenda, and there are clear concerns over the future of independent research and audit. Finally, clinicians from other countries would be well advised to follow such developments because the UK is not unique in its desire to radically modernize and standardize health IT, starting with a drive toward electronic patient records. In April 2004, President Bush issued an executive order calling for US national implementation of electronic medical records within 10 years, from a current baseline of 19% implementation. In a series of presidential speeches he went on to further define health care objectives substantially similar to the UK NPfIT agenda [22]. Therefore, this represents another area in which political and technological developments outside the ICU may have a direct impact on clinical practice and patient safety, and intensivists are strongly recommended to consult early and engage with those driving their local and national health economy. | Conclusion: A variety of emerging technologies are examined here. Very few of these are designed or marketed to be specific to intensive care, and few are traditional 'devices' that can be physically handled or attached to a patient. However, critical care is a distillation of acute hospital practice, and any health care technology that has an impact on diagnosis, monitoring, and management of acute conditions will be of heightened importance in the clinical pressure cooker of intensive care. Point-of-care testing, accelerated microbiological diagnostics, decision support systems and networked IT systems are all key developments that will exert an impact on future critical care practice. | Abbreviations: BSI = bloodstream infection; ICU = intensive care unit; IT = information technology. | Competing interests: The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.

PMC1065257	Characterization of the frameshift signal of Edr, a mammalian example of programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting		INTRODUCTION: Programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting (hereafter frameshifting for brevity) is a translational control mechanism that allows the production of a specific ratio of gene products from two overlapping open reading frames, the relative quantities of which depend upon the frameshift efficiency at that particular site. Frameshifting occurs during the elongation phase of protein synthesis where, in response to elements in the mRNA, the ribosome switches from the zero reading frame to the −1 frame (in the 5′ direction) at a defined position, and translation continues in the new frame. The frameshift signals of this class, first described in retroviruses (1,2), have subsequently been found (mainly) in other virus genomes and in Escherichia coli insertional elements [reviewed in (3–6)]. The mRNA signals that promote frameshifting comprise a slippery sequence, where the frameshift takes place, and a 3′-stimulatory RNA structure, separated from the slippery sequence by a short spacer region. The heptanucleotide slippery sequence typically contains consecutive homopolymeric triplets (XXXYYYZ), with the ribosome-bound tRNAs decoding the P- and A-site codons slipping from the zero frame (X XXY YYZ) to the −1 frame (XXX YYY). Studies of frameshifting in eukaryotic systems have indicated that X can be any nucleotide, Y is almost always A or U, and Z any nucleotide but G (although the YYZ codon is often AAG in prokaryotic systems). Efficient frameshifting also requires the presence of the 3′-stimulatory RNA beginning ∼5–9 nt downstream of the slippery sequence. At some sites, a simple stem–loop structure appears to be necessary and sufficient for frameshifting but more commonly, an RNA pseudoknot structure is present. These are H-(hairpin)-type pseudoknots (7), although some viral pseudoknots have also been described as kissing hairpins (8,9). The mechanism of frameshifting is not fully understood, although a number of models have been proposed to explain how the interaction of the ribosome with the stimulatory RNA leads to a realignment of the tRNAs decoding the slippery sequence into the −1 frame [(10) and references therein]. Computer-assisted database screens have highlighted the potential for −1 frameshifting in conventional cellular genes (11–13), but only two examples with obvious biological relevance have been identified to date. The first is present in the E.coli dnaX gene, encoding the γ and τ subunits of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. The synthesis of the γ protein is by frameshifting, which directs ribosomes to a premature stop codon, while the longest form (τ) is translated by continued standard decoding (14,15). The frameshift occurs at the slippery sequence AAAAAAG, by simultaneous slippage of both P- and A-site tRNALys species from the zero (A AAA AAG) to the −1 frame (AAA AAA) (16,17). This process requires two stimulatory signals in the mRNA, a Shine–Dalgarno-like sequence 10 nt upstream of the slippery sequence and a stem–loop structure 5 nt downstream of it (18,19). The second example, present in the mouse embryonal carcinoma differentiation regulated (Edr) gene, was described more recently (20). Edr and the human orthologue PEG10 [paternally expressed 10 (21)] are single copy genes located on mouse chromosome 6 and human chromosome 7, respectively. High levels of Edr are seen during mouse embryogenesis, with distinct spatial and temporal patterns of mRNA expression observed in the developing musculo-skeletal system. Edr thus appears to play a crucial role in mammalian development, although its exact function is yet to be determined (20). The normal function of the PEG10 protein is also uncertain, although it is associated with the development of human hepatocellular carcinoma (22). The Edr gene has two long, partially overlapping reading frames (RF1 and RF2), with a likely slippery sequence (GGGAAAC) within the overlap region and in the appropriate reading frame. The signal is poorly characterized, but in vitro frameshift assays indicate that ∼30% of ribosomes change frame within the RF1/RF2 overlap region (20). With GGGAAAC as the site of frameshifting, the gene would encode a 37 kDa non-frameshift product (RF1) by normal translation and a 113 kDa fusion protein (RF1–RF2) by frameshifting. RF1 contains a putative zinc-binding domain of the CCHC subclass with a high content of basic amino acids commonly found in retroviral Gag proteins, whereas the protein encoded by RF2 contains a consensus motif for an aspartyl protease catalytic site. Thus, the organization is reminiscent of a retroviral gag/pro overlap and suggests that the Edr frameshift signal is of retroviral origin. Nevertheless, current models of the Edr stimulatory RNA (20) do not resemble closely the kind of structures that have been seen previously at retroviral frameshift signals [reviewed in (23,24)]. As the first eukaryotic cellular example of −1 frameshifting, it is of interest to ascertain whether Edr represents a new class of frameshift signal. In this study, we have used site-directed mutagenesis and RNA structure probing to characterize the Edr signal. We first confirmed the functionality and magnitude of the signal and confirmed a role for the GGGAAAC motif. Subsequently, we derived a model of the Edr stimulatory RNA and assessed its similarity to those stimulatory RNAs found at viral frameshift sites. We found that the structure is an RNA pseudoknot quite different from the one proposed previously (20) but possessing features typical of retroviral frameshifter pseudoknots. From these experiments, we conclude that the Edr signal and by inference, the PEG10 orthologue, do not represent a novel ‘cellular class’ of programmed −1 ribosomal frameshift signal, but rather are similar to viral examples, albeit with some interesting features. | Site-directed mutagenesis ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS: Site-specific mutagenesis was carried out by a procedure based on that of Kunkel (25) as described previously (26). Mutants were identified by dideoxy sequencing of single-stranded templates (27). Sequencing through G+C-rich regions was facilitated by replacing dGTP with deaza-GTP in the sequencing mixes. | Construction of plasmids ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Edr frameshift region was amplified from plasmid pSP64T/Edr (20). A 1230 nt region between mRNA positions 631 and 1861 was amplified using Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega) and forward and reverse primers, respectively: 5′-TACATGCCATGGGTGCTGCAGCAGCCCCTATC-3′ and 5′-TAGTACAAGCTTCCGGCAGCAGAGTCGGCAGTA-3′. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and HindIII and cloned into plasmid pKT0 (28) to create pKT0/Edr (Figure 1). Plasmid pKT0/Edr/T3 was prepared from pKT0/Edr by inserting the sequence 5′-AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGA-3′ at a position 33 nt upstream of the start of the GGGAAAC slippery sequence. This introduced a unique bacteriophage T3 RNA polymerase promotor. All plasmid junctions were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing of single-stranded templates rescued from E.coli JM101. | In vitro transcription and translation ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plasmids for in vitro transcription were prepared using a commercial kit (WizardPlus SV Miniprep; Promega). In vitro transcription reactions employing the bacteriophage SP6 RNA polymerase were carried out essentially as described by Melton et al. (29) and included the synthetic cap structure 7meGpppG (New England Biolabs) to generate capped mRNA. Product RNA was recovered by a single extraction with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (49:49:2) followed by precipitation in ethanol in the presence of 5 M ammonium acetate. The RNA pellet was dissolved in water, and the remaining unicorporated nucleotide triphosphates removed by Sephadex G-50 chromatography. RNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation, dissolved in water and checked for integrity by electrophoresis on 1% (w/v) agarose gels containing 0.1% (w/v) SDS. In ribosomal frameshift assays, purified mRNAs were translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) as described previously (26). Translation products were analysed on SDS-15% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels according to the standard procedures (30). The relative abundance of non-frameshifted and frameshifted products on the gels was determined by direct measurement of [35S]methionine incorporation using a Packard Instant Imager 2024 and adjusted to take into account the differential methionine content of the products. The frameshift efficiencies quoted are the average of at least three independent measurements which varied by <10%, i.e. a measurement of 30% frameshift efficiency was between 27 and 33%. The calculations of frameshift efficiency take into account the differential methionine content of the various products. | RNA structure probing ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS: RNAs for secondary structure probing were prepared by in vitro transcription of NdeI-cut pKT0/Edr/T3 using bacteriophage T3 RNA polymerase. Transcription reactions were on a 200 μl scale and contained 20 μg plasmid DNA, 2.5 mM of each rNTP and 200 U of T3 RNA polymerase (Promega) in a buffer containing 40 mM Tris, pH 8, 15 mM MgCl2 and 5 mM DTT. After 3 h at 37°C, 100 U of DNase I was added and the incubation continued for a further 30 min. Nucleic acids were harvested by extraction with phenol/chloroform (1:1) and ethanol precipitation. DNA fragments were removed by Sephadex G-50 chromatography and the RNA transcripts concentrated by ethanol precipitation. The RNA was quantified by spectrophotometry and its integrity checked by electrophoresis on a 2% (w/v) agarose gel containing 0.1% SDS. Transcripts (10 μg) were 5′ end-labelled with [γ-33P]ATP using a standard dephosphorylation–rephosphorylation strategy (31), purified from 6% acrylamide–urea gels and dissolved in water. The structure probing experiments followed the general principles outlined by others (32–34). All reactions contained 10–50 000 c.p.m. 5′ end-labelled RNA transcript. RNase probing reactions were carried out in 50 μl reaction volumes containing 50 μg carrier E.coli rRNA (Sigma). Enzymatic probing reactions were carried out on ice for 20 min. RNase CL3 [Industrial Research Laboratories (IRL), New Zealand] and RNase T1 (Ambion) probing was in 50 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 7, 2 mM MgCl2 and 0–0.2 units CL3 or T1; RNase V1 (Ambion) in 10 mM Tris, pH 8, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.1 M KCl and 0–0.2 units V1; and RNase U2 (IRL) in 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, 2 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl and 0–0.2 units U2. Enzyme reactions were stopped by the addition of 150 μl ethanol and the RNA recovered by centrifugation. RNAs were prepared for analysis on 6, 10 or 15% polyacrylamide–7 M urea sequencing-type gels [with or without 20% (v/v) formamide] by dissolution in water and mixing with an equal volume of formamide gel loading buffer [95% (v/v) formamide, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% bromophenol blue and 0.1% xylene cyanol], before heating at 80°C for 3 min. Chemical probing was performed with lead acetate and imidazole in 10 μl reaction volumes. Lead probing was at 25°C for 5 min in 20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 5 mM Mg acetate, 50 mM K acetate and 1–5 mM Pb acetate. Reactions were stopped by the addition of EDTA to 33 mM and the RNA recovered by precipitation in ethanol, redissolved in water and prepared for gel loading as above. For imidazole probing, the end-labelled RNA was mixed with 10 μg carrier rRNA, dried in a desiccator and redissolved in 10 μl of 2 M imidazole, pH 7, containing 40 mM NaCl and 10 mM MgCl2. After incubation at 37°C for 2–4 h, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of a fresh solution of 2% (w/v) lithium perchlorate in acetone. The RNA was recovered by centrifugation, washed with acetone, dried, dissolved in water and prepared for gel loading as above. All structure probing gels included an alkaline hydrolysis ladder as a size marker, prepared by dissolving the dried pellet from 3 μl of end-labelled RNA and 10 μg carrier rRNA in 3 μl of 22.5 mM NaHCO3, 2.5 mM Na2CO3 and boiling for 2 min. After the addition of an equal volume of formamide gel loading buffer and heating to 80°C for 3 min, the sample was loaded immediately onto the gel. | Mapping the 3′ boundary of the Edr frameshift signal ::: RESULTS: The 5′ and 3′ boundaries of the Edr frameshift signal were not characterized in the previous study (20), but we began our analysis with the assumption that the 5′ boundary is the GGGAAAC heptamer located within the RF1/RF2 overlap region. A 1230 bp portion of the Edr gene containing this slippery sequence and flanked by substantial lengths of open reading frame was cloned by PCR into the expression vector pKT0 (28) (see Materials and Methods) to generate pKT0/Edr (Figure 1). This plasmid contains a bacteriophage SP6 (and T7) promoter for the generation of in vitro transcripts and provides an optimized (Kozak) initiation codon for the translation of the cloned Edr segment. The cloned PCR product was sequenced to confirm that no errors had been introduced into the Edr sequence. To assess crudely the extent to which 3′ sequences were required for frameshifting, a series of run-off transcripts containing varying lengths of Edr sequence were prepared following digestion of the plasmid with NdeI, AvrII, HindIII or BamHI and transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase (Figure 1). The mRNAs were translated in the RRL in vitro translation system and the products analysed by SDS/PAGE (Figure 2). Frameshifting was observed in all cases with each mRNA showing an efficiency of ∼30% (hereafter the ‘wild-type’ efficiency) in good agreement with the value obtained by Shigemoto et al. (20). The sizes of the non-frameshifted and frameshifted species were consistent with those expected following frameshifting at the RF1/RF2 overlap region (see legend to Figure 2). As the mRNA from the NdeI-digested plasmid (linearized 105 bp downstream of the slippery sequence) stimulated wild-type levels of frameshifting, subsequent investigations focussed on regions upstream of this restriction site. To further delineate the essential sequences, in-frame deletions of 24, 63 or 90 nt were introduced into pKT0/Edr in the region between the GGGAAAC motif and the NdeI site (Figure 3A). The plasmids were linearized with HindIII before in vitro transcription and translation. As shown in Figure 3B, efficient frameshifting was observed only with pKT0/Edr/Δ24 nt, hence the stimulatory RNA is in fact longer than that proposed in the original study (20) (Figure 3A, emboldened bases), with a 3′ boundary located between the 5′ edge of the deletions of pKT0/Edr/Δ63 and Δ24. In addition to the non-frameshifted and frameshifted species, an additional longer product was seen in these translation reactions (Figure 3B, asterisk) and in fact, in all translations of pKT0/Edr to a greater or lesser extent. The identity of this product is uncertain. It is unlikely to be an alternative frameshift product, since its size was unaffected by changes in the length of the mRNA downstream of the frameshift site. However, given that its intensity paralleled that of the non-frameshifted product and its size was roughly double that of the non-frameshifted product, it may represent a stable dimer. | Proposed structure of the frameshift stimulatory signal of the Edr gene ::: RESULTS: The results of the deletion analysis prompted a re-evaluation of the folding possibilities within the RNA downstream of the slippery sequence. Scrutiny of potential base-pairing interactions within this extended region indicated the potential for the formation of an RNA pseudoknot structure, shown in Figure 4B in comparison with the previous models of Shigemoto et al. (20) (Figure 4A). The proposed pseudoknot is positioned ∼5 nt downstream of the GGGAAAC sequence and contains two relatively long stems, linked by loops of three (loop 1) and nine (loop 2) nucleotides. Stem 1 can be subdivided into two regions (1a and 1b) separated by a 3 nt bulge in the second arm. | Site-directed mutagenesis of the Edr frameshift signal ::: RESULTS: To test our model of the Edr frameshift signal, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out. The mutants fell into four groups (i) changes in the putative slippery sequence GGGAAAC, (ii) destabilizing and restabilizing mutations within the predicted stem regions 1a, 1b and 2 (iii) a mutation that deleted the bulge triplet between stems 1a and 1b and (iv) a mutation that changed the central seven (of nine) nucleotides in loop 2 to their complementary Watson–Crick bases. Figure 5 shows the mutations (m1–m12) introduced into the frameshift region of pKT0/Edr (Figure 5A), in vitro translations of the mutant constructs (Figure 5B; mRNAs derived from HindIII-cut plasmids) and a summary of the frameshift efficiencies measured for each construct (Figure 5C). As before the sizes of the non-frameshifted and frameshift species expected from these mRNAs were 29 and 45 kDa, respectively. The two independent mutations created within the putative slippery sequence had the second base of each homopolymeric triplet changed to a C residue (m1 and m2). These changes would reduce the ability of the tRNAs decoding this sequence to slip into the −1 reading frame and consistent with this, each change reduced the frameshifting efficiency (Figure 5). As seen with other frameshift signals, the mutation in the second homopolymeric triplet (GGGACAC, m1), decoded in the ribosomal A-site during the frameshift, was highly inhibitory (frameshifting was essentially abolished), whereas the reduction in efficiency with the P-site change (GCGAAAC, m2) was less dramatic (a 4-fold reduction). These data are entirely consistent with the belief that the GGGAAAC stretch is indeed the site of the frameshift in Edr and confirm the earlier observations of Shigemoto et al. (20). Analysis of the proposed stem regions involved the introduction of complementary and compensatory changes within stems 1a, 1b and 2. Three mutations were prepared for each stem. Two of these were destabilizing mutations, introduced into each arm of the relevant stem by changing three central base pairs to their complementary Watson–Crick bases. The third was a double mutation leading to a ‘pseudowild-type’ structure, in which both changes were made and should be compensatory. As shown in Figure 5, destabilization of any stem reduced frameshifting efficiency (m3, m4, m6, m7, m9 and m10), but frameshifting was restored in the double mutant, pseudowild-type constructs (m5, m8 and m11) supporting the belief that the stems form and are required for frameshifting. However, there was some stem-specific variation in the magnitude by which frameshifting was reduced by stem destabilization and the extent to which frameshifting was restored in the double mutants. For stem 1a, the reduction in frameshift efficiency after disruption of individual arms was quite modest (∼2.5-fold for the 1st arm; ∼6-fold for the 2nd arm), but frameshifting efficiency was restored to close to that of the wild-type in the double mutant construct (m5, 25.6%). Disruption of stem 1b in the same manner also led to a reduction in frameshifting efficiency, but more dramatically, with frameshifting reduced ∼15-fold for either arm. As with the stem 1a double mutant, frameshift efficiency was restored to close to that of the wild-type value with the stem 1b pseudowild-type construct (m8, 24.6%). Disruption of stem 2 was also inhibitory, with efficiency values of ∼2% for mutations in the individual arms. However, although the double mutant construct showed a rise in efficiency in comparison with the single mutants, frameshifting was restored only to about half that of the wild-type construct (m11, 16.5%). The presence of the –ACA– bulge in stem 1 was of interest as a triplet bulge has been observed in the frameshift stimulatory RNA of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and shown to contribute to frameshifting, although the bulge is considered to be a component of a stem–loop stimulatory RNA in this system (35). However, we found that deletion of the bulge had a very minor effect on Edr frameshifting, reducing the efficiency by only a few percent (m13, 26.8%). The final mutation concerned loop 2. In a number of frameshift-stimulating pseudoknots, an adenosine-rich triplex formed between loop 2 and the minor groove of stem 1 has been described and contributes to frameshifting (23,24,36,37). A conserved 5′-AACAA-3′ motif in such loops has its bases rotated by varying degrees to allow interactions with bases on both strands in the minor groove of stem 1. It is an RNA-specific feature, with each interaction involving a hydrogen bond formed from a ribose 2′ hydroxyl group. Loop 2 of the proposed Edr pseudoknot is relatively A-rich (five of nine bases) and includes a 5′-AACGA-3′ stretch. To assess whether loop 2–stem 1 interactions may occur in Edr, the central seven bases of loop 2 were changed to their Watson–Crick complementary nucleotides and frameshifting measured. A modest reduction in frameshifting was observed (m12, 23.2%), but not so dramatic as to suggest a major role for stem 1–loop 2 interactions in this pseudoknot, at least those mediated by runs of loop adenosines, since only one loop 2 adenosine remains in this mutant. | Structure probing of the Edr frameshift signal ::: RESULTS: The mutagenesis data provided strong support for our model of the Edr frameshift region, but it was important to confirm the main features by RNA structure mapping. To facilitate this, a bacteriophage T3 promotor was inserted into pKT0/Edr ∼33 nt upstream of the slippery sequence (Figure 1), the plasmid linearized with NdeI and a 130 nt T3 transcript (encompassing the frameshift region) prepared. This was end-labelled with [γ-33P]ATP, gel purified and subjected to chemical and enzymatic digestion before analysis on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Four enzymatic probes were used: RNases CL3, T1 and U2, which preferentially cleave single-stranded C, G and A residues, respectively, and RNase CV1, which targets double-stranded and stacked bases. The chemical probes imidazole and lead acetate were also employed, which show specificity for single-stranded regions. In these experiments, the Mg2+ level was kept at 2 mM, which is the approximate concentration of this ion in RRL (38). Representative structure probing gels are shown in Figure 6 and a summary is shown in Figure 7. The structure probing data were strongly supportive of the pseudoknot model of Figure 4. The cleavage pattern of imidazole especially was highly consistent with the model, with cleavage occurring only within loops 1 and 2, at the very ends of the stems and in the –ACA– bulge of stem 1. Lead acetate gave a similar cleavage pattern, although there were more cuts at the ends of the stems. Taking all of the probing reagents into account, the pattern of reactivities of stem 2, loop 1 and loop 2 matched the structure prediction very closely. Stem 2 appeared to be very stable in comparison with the same region of other frameshift-stimulating pseudoknots we have studied (39–41). It was cleaved almost exclusively by the double-strand specific RNase CV1, being unreactive with single-stranded enzymatic probes and showing only occasional, weak cleavage with single-stranded chemical probes. The loops also showed appropriate reactivity. Both were cleaved by single-stranded chemical probes and loop 2 also by single-strand-specific enzymes. Only C89 of loop 2 exhibited any consistent cleavage with CV1 and this may indicate some base-stacking. Although loop 1 was not reactive to single-strand-specific enzymatic probes, this probably reflects a reduced accessibility of enzymes to this short loop. The most unexpected features of this stimulatory RNA were the atypical cleavage pattern of stem 1 and the paucity of cleavages in the slippery sequence/spacer region. The assignment of cleavages in these areas was complicated by a strong compression effect in the gels (see Figure 6A, between bases 40 and 60), presumably arising from stable base-pairing, which was not completely relieved (although much improved) by running reactions on highly denaturing gels containing 20% formamide (Figure 6B). Nevertheless, we were able to assign almost all of the reactivities in this region, and it was noticeable that stem 1, especially stem 1a, showed susceptibility to cleavage by single-strand-specific enzymatic probes, notably RNase T1 at residues G80–82. Similarly, RNase CL3, a C-specific reagent also showed cleavage at some of the C residues in stem 1. Although it can be argued that the the –ACA– bulge in stem 1 would introduce some deformation of the (presumably) A-form helix and increase accessibility of adjacent bases to enzymatic probes, we did not see an increased access of chemical probes, arguing against a severe bulge-induced destabilization of stem 1a. It may be that stem 1a exists in equilibrium with another conformation and one such possibility is shown in Figure 7B. In this alternative model, the first arm of stem 1a is proposed to pair with an upstream region (G35–G40), displacing the second arm of stem 1a and the bulge triplet into loop 2. Some features of this alternative model are attractive, e.g. the cleavage of G80–82 by RNase T1 is rationalized as these residues would be located in loop 2. Similarly, the limited reactivity of the slippery sequence and spacer region to single-strand cleavage reagents could be attributed to the fact that much of the region is folded into a hairpin. However, the alternative model also has flaws, most noticeably that the pattern of reactivities of the bases in the second arm of stem 1a is not fully consistent with their location in loop 2. These bases should show increased sensitivity to lead acetate and imidazole and reduced CV1 cleavage, neither of which was observed. In addition, one might expect that the sensitivity of G80–82 to RNase T1 would be similar to that of the other G's in loop 2 (G86 and G90), which also was not the case. Based on the mutational analysis (Figure 5) and the chemical probing data, we favour the idea that stem 1a folds according to the original prediction, but shows breathing or flips occasionally into an alternative conformation (perhaps the one described above). This behaviour might account for the fact that destabilization of the stem did not reduce frameshifting as dramatically as those mutations that destabilized stem 1b or stem 2 (Figure 5). Nevertheless, it remains difficult to explain the strong reactivity of the G's (to RNase T1) in the second arm of stem 1a. It may be that unusual structural features are present that promote RNase T1 cleavage. This idea is not without precedent. Structure probing of the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) frameshift-stimulating pseudoknot (S. Pennell and I. Brierley, unpublished data), functional derivatives of this pseudoknot (40,41) and a functional derivative of the RSV pseudoknot (39) has also revealed unexpected RNase T1 reactivity towards apparently base-paired G residues, although in these pseudoknots, at the top of stem 2. | DISCUSSION: In this study, the secondary structure of the Edr frameshift signal was investigated using site-directed mutagenesis and RNA structure probing. The results obtained clearly demonstrate that the stimulatory RNA downstream of the slippery sequence folds into an RNA pseudoknot which, although different from an earlier study (20), undoubtedly resembles the frameshift-promoting pseudoknots of virus signals. The Edr frameshift site comprises a slippery sequence GGGAAAC, a 5 nt spacer region and a relatively large pseudoknot (in viral terms) with 10 bp in stem 1, 9 in stem 2 and loops of 3 (loop1) and 9 (loop 2) nucleotides. In comparison with viral frameshift signals, Edr does not fit into a specific category, but has hallmarks of different viruses. The possession of relatively long pseudoknot stems, especially stem 2, is a feature of the frameshift signals present at the pro/pol overlap of the retroviruses human T-cell lymphotrophic virus (HTLV) types 1 and 2, simian T-cell lymphotrophic virus type 1 and bovine leukaemia virus, and also of the coronaviruses, although in these viruses, the pseudoknots are accompanied by the slippery sequence UUUAAAC rather than GGGAAAC (26,42–44). In terms of loop lengths, Edr resembles most closely those pseudoknots found at the gag/pro overlap of the retroviruses Maedi–Visna virus, Mason–Pfizer monkey virus, feline immunodeficiency virus and simian retrovirus (SRV) types 1 and 2, which possess relatively short loops and also employ the slippery sequence GGGAAAC (42). The loops of the Edr pseudoknot are short but sufficiently long to span the stems (7,37). That we have identified the entire frameshift region seems likely from the results of our mutational analysis and from phylogenetic sequence comparisons. In Figure 7A, nucleotides within and surrounding the pseudoknot that differ in the human orthologue, PEG10, are shown. As can be seen, almost all of the sequence variation occurs before the slippery sequence and immediately following stem 2. Four nucleotide differences are present within the frameshift region, but of these, only one is likely to have an effect on pseudoknot function, namely the G to A transition at the top of stem 2. Of the other three changes, one is within the stem 1 bulge and the other two in loop 2. As we have shown experimentally that the bulge in stem 1 is not required for frameshifting and that most of the sequence of loop 2 can be changed without consequence, it seems that these changes are in ‘neutral’ regions. The stem 2 transition itself would only affect the ultimate stem 2 base pair and would likely have only a modest effect on frameshift efficiency. From the perspective of phylogenetics, it will be interesting to see whether Edr orthologues are present in other mammalian species. This will be informative in assessing the conservation of the pseudoknot and the stage in mammalian evolution at which the Edr gene was acquired. An unexpected feature of the Edr pseudoknot was the marked accessibility of single-strand-specific enzymatic reagents to stem 1a in the structure probing experiments. In the discussion of these data in the Results section above, this accessibility was hypothesized to be a consequence of a relative instability of stem 1a or the presence of a specific stem 1 conformation highly reactive to single-stranded enzymatic probes, such as RNase T1 and CL3. In related investigations of the IBV (40,45), SRV-1 (31) and RSV pseudoknots (39), stem 2, rather than stem 1, proved to be more sensitive to single-stranded probes and possessed unusual susceptibility to RNase T1 (CL3 was not used in these studies). Another difference was highlighted in our mutational analysis of the Edr pseudoknot, where a complementary change that destabilized the first arm of stem 1a still retained about two-fifths of the wild-type frameshifting efficiency (Figure 5, m3 12.2%). In most models of ribosomal frameshifting, a ribosomal pause is proposed to occur upon encounter of the pseudoknot, perhaps because of a failure to unwind the pseudoknot efficiently, and this pause occurs while the decoding centre is over the slippery sequence. In constructs with a stem 1 destabilization, one would expect frameshifting to be greatly reduced, since the ribosome would translate further into the structure (since stem 1 affords less resistance) and fail to pause, or pause at an inappropriate place. Certainly, in the IBV, SRV-1 and RSV pseudoknots (cited above), destabilization of stem 1 has generally proven to be highly inhibitory in comparison with equivalent changes in stem 2. The substantial frameshift efficiency engendered by the m3 mutant may simply indicate the adoption of an alternative (fortuitous) conformation that partially restores stem 1 function. However, it may also highlight a mechanistic aspect of Edr frameshifting, pointing towards a different contribution of the stems to ribosomal pausing and/or a different pathway of unwinding during the frameshift process (23,24). Perhaps in Edr, stem 2, rather than stem 1, is critical in determining the site of pausing or the rate of initial unwinding of the pseudoknot. If this is the case, the stability of stem 1 may be less crucial. Further work is required to ascertain the relative contribution of the two stems to frameshifting in this system. A detailed analysis of related structures (e.g. the HTLV-1 pro/pol frameshift signal) may also prove to be valuable. Several virus pathogens utilize −1 ribosomal frameshifting, including the retrovirus HIV-1 (46), the coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS-CoV (47)] and numerous plant pathogens [for example, see (48,49,50)]. Frameshifting signals have thus been considered as targets for antiviral intervention (51,52). The existence of related signals in eukaryotic cellular genes, however, would potentially complicate the design of, or even prevent the use of such therapies, particularly if the cellular frameshifting signal(s) was structurally similar to the virus examples. The report of frameshifting in the mouse Edr gene provided the first opportunity to characterize such a cellular signal. We have demonstrated here that the Edr signal resembles viral examples closely, with a characteristic slippery sequence—spacer-pseudoknot organization. Thus, the similarity of parts of the Edr coding sequence to the gag/pro region of retroviral genomes extends to the maintenance of a retrovirus-like frameshifting signal. Given this, and the possibility that other retrovirus-like motifs have been subsumed into mammalian genes and retained a role for frameshifting, antiviral agents that target this process may have previously unanticipated consequences on cellular metabolism in uninfected cells.

PMC1072802	Torsional restraint: a new twist on frameshifting pseudoknots		INTRODUCTION: The structure of an RNA molecule is widely recognized to play a role in many processes, including structurally organizing complex RNAs, the assembly of ribonucleoprotein complexes, and in translational recoding and regulation [reviewed in (1)]. One common RNA folding motifs is a pseudoknot, the folding back of a single-stranded RNA onto itself to form two helical structures with single-stranded loops joining them (2). Many such structures can be inferred from RNA sequences and frameshifting function has been demonstrated for some of these [reviewed in (3–5)]. However, though much theoretical progress has been made in understanding how mRNA pseudoknots promote efficient −1 ribosomal frameshifting (6), a complete understanding of this mechanism remains untested. Programmed −1 ribosomal frameshift signals are typically divided into three components. From 5′ to 3′ these are (i) a ‘slippery site’ in the form N NNW WWH, where N must be a stretch of any three identical nucleotides, where W is either three A or U residues, and H is A, C or U (spacing indicates the unshifted zero frame), (ii) a spacer region and (iii) an mRNA structural element, most often a pseudoknot. The general model posits that upon encountering the mRNA pseudoknot, an elongating ribosome is forced to pause such that the anticodons of its A- and P-site tRNAs are base-paired with the zero-frame codons of the slippery site. The nature of the tRNA–mRNA interactions is such that a relative slip of −1 nucleotide still allows base-pairing in the non-wobble positions. The slippage occurs during the ribosomal pause, and it has been shown that changes affecting ribosome pause times affect frameshift efficiencies [reviewed in (7)]. An important observation is that even though mRNA pseudoknots and energetically equivalent stem–loop structures appear to promote ribosome pausing with equal effectiveness, mRNA pseudoknots are more efficient at promoting −1 PRF (8). Our ‘9 Å’ model (6) provided a refinement of the original ‘simultaneous slippage’ (9,10) model of frameshifting by suggesting that rather than the entire ribosome having to slip one base in the 5′ direction, slippage could be accomplished by moving the small section of mRNA in the downstream tunnel by one base in the 3′ direction. We have proposed that this is accomplished by the bulky and difficult to unwind mRNA pseudoknot structures becoming wedged in the downstream entrance tunnel of the ribosome, preventing the downstream region of the mRNA from being pulled into the ribosome by the equivalent of one base during the accommodation step of elongation. This blockage would introduce tension into the spacer region, which could be resolved by unpairing the mRNA from the tRNAs, allowing the mRNA to slip 1 nt backwards, resulting in a net shift of reading frame by −1 base. Though the 9 Å model provides a partial explanation for why mRNA pseudoknots promote programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting (−1 PRF) more efficiently than simple stem–loop structures, it does not answer the question of how the mRNA pseudoknot directs the ribosome to pause at the correct position along the mRNA. A complementary ‘torsional restraint’ model addresses this issue (11). When a stem–loop structure is unwound by an elongating ribosome, unwinding of the stem forces the loop to rotate. Since a simple stem–loop is not restrained, the loop can rotate freely and only the base pairs within the stem resist ribosomal movement, and thus the potential energy of unwinding should be distributed along the length of Stem 1 (Figure 1A). However, if the loop is anchored or restrained, as it is in a pseudoknot by Stem 2, since the intrinsic ribosomal helicase is processive (12), Stem 1 cannot be fully unwound until Stem 2 is first denatured. Mechanically, as the ribosome begins to unwind the base of Stem 1, Stem 2 forces the supercoiling in the remainder of Stem 1, providing extra resistance to ribosome movement. At some specific point, the resistance to ribosome movement provided by the supercoiling counteracts the forward movement of the ribosome, increasing the likelihood that the ribosome will stop at a precise point along the mRNA. Energetically, since full unwinding of Stem 1 is dependent on complete denaturation of Stem 2, the potential energy of unwinding of the pseudoknot structure should similarly be directed toward one point. Viewed either mechanically or energetically, this point is where ribosomes will be directed to specifically pause on the mRNA. If it occurs with the tRNAs in ribosomal A- and P-sites positioned at the slippery site, then frameshifting is stimulated. This is summarized in Figure 1B. The efficiency of −1 PRF can thus be viewed as a function of (i) the fraction of ribosomes paused over the slippery site and (ii) the rate at which the structure can be denatured. There is increasing evidence from single molecule experiments that unfolding occurs in quick ‘rips’ at a particular force (13), suggesting that in the case of unfolding pseudoknots, frameshifting efficiency is related to both the energy barriers to unfolding the pseudoknot structure and the resistance of the structure against the force of the ribosome. In the context of the torsional restraint model, this resistance is dependent on the ability of Stem 2 to remain intact while Stem 1 is being unwound. There is experimental data that indirectly support this model: (i) disruption of the first 3 bp of Stem 1, which would displace the ribosome's pause site to a point 3′ of the slippery site, has been shown to eliminate frameshifting (14); (ii) destabilizing Stem 2, which would allow it to be unwound more readily, has been shown to result in decreased frameshifting efficiency (15–17); (iii) replacing bulges in Stem 1 with base pairs would increase the energy required to unwind the first three bases, and a longer ribosomal pause over the slippery site would follow, yielding increased efficiencies in −1 frameshifting (15,18); (iv) destabilizing the base of Stem 1 by replacing G:C base pairs with A:U pairs decreases −1 frameshifting efficiencies (19,20); (v) the model eliminates the need for a ‘pseudoknot recognizing factor’, the evidence of which has not been forthcoming in either competition assays in in vitro translation systems (21) or by gel retardation assays (J. D. Dinman, unpublished data); and (vi) elimination of a potential torsion-restraining Stem 2, but not of a non-torsion-restraining Stem 2 in HIV-1, resulted in decreased −1 PRF efficiencies (22). Though all of the cited studies support the torsional restraint model, none has directly addressed it. In the experiments presented in this study, a series of ‘pseudo-pseudoknot’ containing reporter constructs were used to test the torsional restraint hypothesis. In vitro frameshifting assays show that frameshifting can be significantly stimulated by limiting the rotational freedom of the loop region of a stem–loop structure, and that the degree of rotational freedom of Stem 1 is important in determining the extent of −1 PRF. Furthermore, mRNA toeprint analyses reveal a pseudo-pseudoknot-specific strong stop 16 nt 3′ of the slippery site, consistent with this structure being able to direct ribosomes to pause with their A- and P-sites positioned at the slippery site. | Construction of plasmids ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS: All synthetic DNA oligonucleotides were purchased by IDT (Coralville, IA). The modified L-A viral −1 PRF signal containing the G GGU UUA slippery site followed by a simple stem–loop was amplified from pJD18 (23) using the primers luc5′b (5′-CCCCAAGCTTATGACTTCTAGGCAGGGTTTAGG-3′) and luc3′b (5′-CCCCCCATGGGACGTTGTAAAAACGACGGGATC-3′). These were digested with HindIII and NcoI (restriction sites are underlined) and cloned into the firefly luciferase reporter plasmid pT7-LUC minus 3′-untranslated region-A50 (24). In the resulting reporter construct (pJD214-18), expression of firefly luciferase requires a −1 frameshift, and the 5′ sequence of the Stem 2 is not able to base pair with the 3′ sequence, so that only a stem–loop rather than a pseudoknot is able to form. The same primers were used to amplify DNA from pJDRΨ (23) to make pJD214-Rψ. In this construct, complementary mutations (5′-GCUGGC-3′ to 5′-CGACCG-3′) in the 3′ acceptor sequence of the pseudoknot-forming region of Stem 2 allow the formation of an mRNA pseudoknot that has previously been shown to promote frameshifting at the same frequency as the wild type (23). The primer luc5′CON (5′-CCCCAAGCTTATGACTTCTAGGCAAGGGTTTAGG-3′) contains an additional A nucleotide upstream of the slippery site and was used to make pJD214-0, the zero-frame control. To eliminate the possibility of internal initiation occurring at the luciferase initiation codon downstream of the frameshift signals, the AUG codon was changed to AUA. The Stratagene QuikChange kit was used to mutate pJD214-18 and pJD214-Rψ into pJD336-18 and pJD366-Rψ, respectively, using the oligonucleotides 5′-GGCGTTCTTCTATGGGACGTTGTAAAAACGGATC-3′ and 5′-GATCCGTCGTTTTTACAACGTCCCATAGAAGACGCC-3′ (the mutated codon is underlined). pJD366-18 was further mutated to make a zero-frame control by placing an A upstream of the slippery site using the oligonucleotides 5′-TGACTTCTAGGCAAGGGTTTAGGAGTG and 5′-CACTCCTAAACCCTTGCCTAGAAGTCA (the inserted base is underlined). A series of synthetic DNA oligonucleotides were designed to join the loop acceptor region of mRNA transcribed from pJD366-18 to the downstream region that forms the pseudoknot in the wild-type L-A −1 PRF signal. In the J-oligos, the 3′ sequences base pair with the loop of the mRNA transcribed from pJD366-18, and the 5′ regions of these oligos base pair with the downstream sequence. This orientation is reversed for the R-oligos. These general orientations are shown in Figure 3B. The naming of the oligonucleotide names refers to the number of additional residues placed between the regions of complementarity. The bases complementary to the pJD366-18 sequence are underlined.

Proteins were eliminated by the addition of 2 μl of 1 mg/ml proteinase K and SDS to a final concentration of 0.5% followed by digestion at 50°C for 30 min. Volumes were then increased to 100 μl, extracted twice with phenol/chloroform, and DNA was precipitated with 10 μl NH4Ac and 250 μl ethanol. The purified DNA was resuspended in DEPC-treated H2O. To prepare synthetic mRNAs, 2 μl of purified linear DNAs were used for in vitro transcription using the Ambion T7 mMachine mMessage kit. RNAs were precipitated using 30 μl DEPC H2O and 25 μl LiAc. The RNA was resuspended in 11 μl DEPC H2O (1 μl in 500 would give an OD260 of 0.05–00.1; 1–2 μg/μl). | In vitro translation and frameshifting assays ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS: To anneal the oligonucleotides with the mRNA, J-oligos, R-oligos or the equivalent volumes of dilution buffer alone (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mM MgCl2 and 50 mM EDTA final concentration) were added to synthetic mRNA (0.5 μg), and the mixtures were first incubated in a 70°C heating block for 10 min; the block was then removed and allowed to cool to 37°C (30 min), after which they were briefly spun down and incubated on ice. In all experiments, the molar ratios of J- and R-oligos to synthetic mRNAs were 100:1. In experiments using the competing oligonucleotide (C-oligo), this was added to either 0.5:1 or 1:1 molar ratios with either J- or R-oligonucleotides. Reticulocyte lysates were thawed on ice, 15 μl of −met and 15 μl of −leu master mixes plus 20 μl of H2O were added to 400 μl of lysate, and 19 μl of this was added to each annealed reaction to start the in vitro translation reactions. These were incubated at 30°C for 60 min (the reaction reached a plateau after 30–35 min where the greatest difference was seen between the zero-frame controls and the frameshifting plasmids) (data not shown), and the reactions were then placed on ice. An aliquot of 7.5 μl from each in vitro translation reaction was added to 50 μl of the prewarmed luciferase reagent, and luminescence readings were taken after a 3 s delay for 15 s in triplicate using a Turner 20/20 Luminometer. | RNase assay ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS: Synthetic transcripts generated from DraI-digested pJD366-18 (∼1.7 kb) were 5′ end labeled using [γ-32P]CTP. These RNAs (4 μl) were incubated with 1 μl of annealing buffer and either 1 μl of H2O or 1 μl of an oligo (0.25 ng) at 70°C. The heating block was allowed to cool at room temperature for 40 min before 8 μl of RNaseH buffer was added (20 mM HEPES, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM DTT). An aliquot of 1 μl of enzyme was added (mung bean nuclease, RNaseH or RNaseT1) and the reactions incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The reactions were stopped by adding 4 μl of stop solution, the products separated through a 6% polyacrylamide–urea denaturing gel and visualized by autoradiography. | mRNA toeprinting ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS: JD366-18 mRNA (1 μg in 8 μl) was annealed with 2 μl of 3′ end-labeled toeprinting primer (5′-CGTACGTGATCTTCACC-3′, complementary to sequence 240 bp 3′ of the slippery site) as described above. This was added to 15 μl of lysate (200 μl Ambion retic lysate, 7.5 μl of each master mix [−leu and −met] and 70 μl of 250 mM KCl), except for 2 μl, which was added to 15 μl of RT buffer [50 mM Tris–HCl (25), 40 mM KCl, 6 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT and 575 μM dNTPs] to be used as a no-ribosome control. In vitro translation reactions were incubated at room temperature for 10 min, which was empirically determined to provide the optimum amount of time to allow ribosomes to initiate translation and pause at the frameshift signal. Subsequently, 15 μl of RT buffer containing RNasin inhibitor and cycloheximide (to a final concentration of 100 ng/μl) was added to stop translation. To this, 2 μl of Superscript II (Invitrogen) was added and the reaction incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Reactions were terminated by phenol:chloroform extraction and 15 μl of stop solution added. The toeprinting primer was also used in conjunction with pJD366-18 to produce sequencing ladders by standard dideoxynucleotide chain termination methods using Sequenase (USB). Products were separated though 6% polyacrylamide–urea denaturing gels and visualized using a Storm phosphorImager (Pharmacia). | Pseudo-pseudoknots stimulate frameshifting, and frameshifting efficiency changes with the degree of pseudo-pseudoknot rotational freedom ::: RESULTS: We previously showed in intact yeast cells that the pseudoknot containing mRNA produced from pJDRΨ was able to promote efficient −1 PRF, whereas one in which only a stem–loop can form, transcribed from pJD18, could not (23). As a first step in this study, we tested the ability of synthetic mRNAs produced from pJD366-RΨ and from pJD366-18, two plasmids derived from these parental constructs, to promote −1 PRF. Total luciferase activities produced from these synthetic mRNAs were divided by the luciferase activity produced from the zero-frame control plasmid, pJD366-0, and multiplied by 100% to determine −1 PRF efficiencies. The results show that the trends observed in yeast were replicated in vitro, i.e. JD366-RΨ mRNA promoted ∼8% efficiency of −1 PRF as compared with ∼1.1% promoted by JD366-18 mRNA (Figure 2). The ‘torsional restraint’ model predicts that conditions that would inhibit the rotational freedom of the loop region of the pJD366-18-derived mRNA should result in enhanced −1 PRF efficiency. The strategy used in this study was to anneal this mRNA with synthetic oligonucleotides complementary to both the loop region and to the sequence downstream that is normally involved in pseudoknot formation. These ‘pseudo-pseudoknots’ would be predicted to restore a pseudoknot-like structure to the mRNA. This is diagrammed in Figure 3A. Two different classes of oligonucleotides having different orientations relative to the mRNA were used to this end: ‘joining’ (J-) and ‘reverse’ (R-) oligos. The orientation of the J-oligos promotes the formation of a structure containing the equivalent of a Loop 2 region, while that of the R-oligos promotes a Loop 1 equivalent. The model also predicts that pseudo-pseudoknots having different degrees of rotational freedom should promote different frequencies of ribosome pausing over the slippery site, resulting in different efficiencies of −1 PRF. In order to control this parameter, increasing numbers of nucleotides were inserted between the mRNA hybridizing regions of the J- and R-oligos. The additional non-complementary bases in the J-oligos are 3′ to the stem–loop residues involved in Stem 2, thus effectively increasing Loop 2. Similarly, the additional non-complementary bases in the R-oligos are 5′ to the loop acceptor residues and correspond to an increased Loop 1. The structure of the stem–loop of pJD366-18 and its maximum base-paired interactions with representative J- and R-oligos are shown in Figure 3B. To demonstrate that an oligonucleotide–mRNA hybrid was capable of forming under the assay conditions, the J1-oligo was incubated with 5′ [32P]labeled JD366-18 mRNA and subjected to RNaseH digestion. Digestion of the RNA–DNA hybrid resulted in a labeled 110 nt fragment, demonstrating that the oligonucleotide bound to the mRNA at the position of the pseudoknot (Figure 4). Having demonstrated the utility of the in vitro frameshifting assay and that the J- and R-series of oligonucleotides were able to hybridize with synthetic mRNA produced from pJD366-18, the next step was to monitor frameshifting efficiencies promoted by these hybrid species. Significant increases in frameshifting were observed with the incubation of pJD366-18 mRNA with oligonucleotides J1 (∼10%) and J2 (∼35%), while only modest increases were seen with J3 and J4 (Figure 5). These findings are consistent with the notion that changes in the degree of rotational freedom of the structure would affect the distribution of paused ribosomes in the vicinity of the slippery site. One potential complication with the J-oligos is the possibility that they could interact with the Loop 2–Stem 1 region. In the R-oligos, the additional bases are distal to any possible Loop 2–Stem 1 interactions and would be more analogous to increasing Loop 1. The R-oligos stimulated −1 PRF to an even higher extent than the J-oligos (Figure 5). Importantly, increasing the length of the bridging regions in these oligonucleotides (R1 to R3), which is predicted to increase the rotational freedom of the stem–loop, resulted in decreased frameshifting activity as predicted by the torsional resistance model. However, addition of three residues between the two binding regions of the R-oligo (R4) resulted in an unexpected increase in frameshifting with a very large amount of variation. In a series of control experiments, 8 nt oligos complementary to the 5′ (Loop 1) and 3′ Stem 2 forming regions of the pseudo-pseudoknot were hybridized to the SL mRNA and −1 PRF assays were performed. Neither of these were able to stimulate −1 PRF, even at concentrations in 100-fold molar excess to the mRNA template (data not shown). Though supportive of our central hypothesis, it is also possible that these results were due to the thermodynamic instability of the RNA:DNA duplexes through the course of the experimental protocol. | Pseudo-pseudoknot structure and function can be competed away ::: RESULTS: To determine whether the stimulation of frameshifting was specifically due to the bridging of the stem–loop with downstream sequence (the pseudo-pseudoknot), as opposed to the nonspecific presence of an RNA:DNA hybrid, the competing oligonucleotide (C-oligo) was designed to form a 15 bp duplex with JD366-18 mRNA, including the 3′ Stem 2 forming region, which was expected to significantly out compete either the J- or R-oligos from binding to this site, thus disrupting formation of the pseudo-pseudoknot (see Figure 3A). Additionally, in the presence of the C-oligo, the J- and R-oligos were still predicted to hybridize with the 5′ Stem 2 forming region, enabling us to address the question of whether this interaction alone was able to stimulate frameshifting. The results demonstrate that the addition of the C-oligo severely inhibited the abilities of both the J- and R-oligos to promote efficient frameshifting (Figure 6). These findings demonstrate that (i) frameshifting was specifically stimulated by bridging of the 5′ and 3′ Stem 2 forming regions by the J- and R-oligos, and (ii) that the presence of an RNA:DNA hybrid at the 5′ Stem 2 forming region was not sufficient to stimulate frameshifting by itself. | Pseudo-pseudoknots direct ribosomes to pause over the slippery site ::: RESULTS: The torsional restraint model predicts that pseudoknots should direct elongating ribosomes to pause at one specific location on the mRNA, rather than being distributed along Stem 1. We used mRNA toeprint assays to test this hypothesis. In mRNA toeprint reactions, the movement of reverse transcriptase is blocked by paused ribosomes, resulting in a strong stop positioned ∼16–18 nt 3′ of the P-site of eukaryotic ribosomes (25). Synthetic JD366-18 mRNAs were annealed with the sequencing oligonucleotide and either J1, R1 or no second oligo, and these were then used for in vitro translation reactions. After a period of time (10 min were empirically determined to be optimal), elongation reactions were stopped by the addition of cycloheximide, and reverse transcription reactions were initiated on the sequencing oligonucleotides. In parallel, control reverse transcription reactions were carried out using synthetic JD366-18 mRNA and oligonucleotides, but without in vitro translation. The results are consistent with the model, showing that the J1- and R1-oligos specifically promoted one strong reverse transcriptase stop 16 nt 3′ of the P-site of the slippery site only the in the in vitro translation reactions (Figure 7). As further predicted by the model, a broad distribution of stops of equal intensities was observed in this region with JD366-18 mRNA alone (Figure 7, lane 1). Importantly, the +16 stop was not observed when toeprint reactions were carried in the absence of ribosomes. Additional strong stops were also of interest. One corresponding to the 3′ end of the base of Stem 1 was observed in all samples, consistent with the presence of this structure. Both J- and R-oligo-specific pauses were also observed. The reason for the strong pause in the J-oligo is unknown. The R-oligo-specific pause is perhaps more revealing. It occurs at the 3′ end of the RNA:DNA hybrid formed by this oligo and the mRNA, a structure that should also promote pausing of reverse transcriptase. | DISCUSSION: The results presented in this study provide strong support for the torsional restraint model of programmed −1 frameshifting. Specifically, we demonstrated that RNA:DNA hybrids that mimic mRNA pseudoknots can significantly stimulate frameshifting. As predicted by the model, changing the rotational freedom of the structure by altering the lengths in the J1- and R1-oligos between the 5′ and 3′ mRNA hybridizing regions resulted in changes in their abilities to stimulate −1 frameshifting. The demonstration that these ‘pseudo-pseudoknot’ structures cause elongating ribosomes to specifically pause with their A- and P-sites positioned at the slippery site provides independent evidence in support of the model. In the case of the J-oligo series, frameshifting was best stimulated by J2, suggesting the structure created and the rotational freedom allowed by it was optimal for −1 PRF. The experimental design is such that we assume a similar rate of unfolding for each oligo as the predicted maximum base pairing is the same for them all. However, we do note that the type of nucleotides separating the two, separately paired regions of the oligos, and their presentation, may play a role in −1 PRF efficiency. The recent NMR structural solution of the SRV-1 pseudoknot revealed a highly structured Loop 2–Stem 1 interface including base triples involving an A residue at the 3′ end of Loop 2 (26). The additional base in the J2-oligonucleotide is also an A. Mutagenesis experiments in this region by other groups showed, for example, that replacing the 3′ base in Loop 2 of IBV with an A residue promoted a significant increase in frameshifting efficiency (27), and mutation or removal of the A residue at the 3′ base in Loop 2 of the BWYV pseudoknot reduced frameshifting levels (17). This part of the pseudoknot has been proposed to be important in a frameshifting model where differential transition state energy barriers (due to small differences in local structure, stability or dynamics) are the primary determinant of frameshifting efficiency (3). Indeed, a Loop 2–Stem 1 triplex interaction seen in smaller frameshifting pseudoknots from luteoviruses has been shown to be critical for −1 PRF, and that similar pseudoknots lacking the triplex are less efficient at frameshifting [(28) and references therein]. This extra structural feature would limit the rate of unfolding and provide extra anchoring of Stem 2 as the ribosome attempts to unwind Stem 1, i.e. it too would help to provide additional torsional restraint. It is also possible that although the J3- and J4-oligonucleotides also help to form a pseudo-pseudoknot, the additional bases may interfere with the stabilization of Stem 1. With the R-oligos, a general correlation was observed between minimization of rotational freedom and frameshifting efficiency, though this was not the case of the R4-oligo. Since the stability of the pseudo-pseudoknot generated with R4 should be similar to that of the other oligonucleotides based on the base-pairing, this result suggests that there are additional considerations to be uncovered with regard to the pseudoknot structure influencing frameshifting. Addition of residues in the R-oligos was analogous to lengthening Loop 1, which is typically short in −1 frameshifting pseudoknots. Limited and conflicting data are available on the importance of Loop 1 in −1 frameshifting pseudoknots. In one study, addition of three A bases to Loop 1 did not affect frameshifting efficiency (15), while in another all the mutations made in this region were detrimental to frameshifting efficiency (17). Given the complex interactions occurring between the helices and loops in this region, we cannot yet account for why the R4-oligo stimulated frameshifting so efficiently and with such variable results. Examination of the RNA toeprint data presented here reveals that both of the pseudo-pseudoknot structures formed by the J1- and R1-oligos promoted strong stops of the reverse transcriptase ∼16 nt 3′ of the P-site codon of the slippery site, consistent with the hypothesis that the presence of Stem 2 forces ribosomes to pause with their A- and P-sites positioned over the slippery site. Previous studies mapping the lagging edge of paused ribosomes, i.e. mRNA heelprint studies, did not reveal any striking differences between the effects of pseudoknots versus stem–loops (8,16). Interestingly, using this method, the ribosomal pauses appeared distributed over a broader stretch of mRNA (∼4 nt) than observed here. It is possible that some critical level of resolution is lost in the requirement for many additional manipulations of substrates using the mRNA heelprint as compared with the toeprint methods. A remaining question centers on whether the role of the RNA pseudoknot in −1 PRF is passive or active. In the ‘9 Å solution’ (6), the frameshift mechanism is activated by movement of the A-site codon–anticodon complex by 1 base in the 5′ direction upon accommodation. As currently described, the mRNA pseudoknot merely passively blocks entry of the downstream message into the ribosome, resulting in stretching of the segment of mRNA located between the codon–anticodon complex and the pseudoknot. By this model, all of the energetic input for the frameshift is derived from hydrolysis of GTP by eEF1A. However, it is possible that the pseudoknot may also actively contribute to the frameshift mechanism. Specifically, pulling the downstream message into the ribosome at accommodation could result in unwinding of Stem 1 of the pseudoknot by one additional base pair. The energetic cost of so doing would be to introduce an equivalent amount of torsional resistance into Stem 2. If Stem 2 were to release this resistance by ‘pulling back’, the base pair in Stem 1 would be re-formed, which in turn would contribute to the energy required to dissociate the A- and P-site codon–anticodon complexes from the zero-frame. This would be followed by slippage of the mRNA by 1 base in the 3′ direction relative to the ribosome, followed by the formation of −1 frame codon–anticodon complexes. As such, the proposed active role for the mRNA pseudoknot would further reduce the energetic barrier to −1 PRF. In sum, we suggest that the ‘torsional restraint model’ can be combined with the ‘9 Å solution’ to mechanistically explain the original ‘simultaneous slippage’ model of −1 PRF (9,10). In other words, the 9 Å solution + torsional restraint = simultaneous slippage. Two recent publications have also shown that oligonucleotide:mRNA duplexes can stimulate efficient −1 ribosomal frameshifting (29,30). These studies differed from the present one in a number of ways, particularly insofar as they examined the effects duplex structures immediately 3′ of the slippery site rather than addressing mRNA pseudoknot related questions. The findings support the notion that the specific location of ribosome pausing on the mRNA plays a critical role in determining frameshifting, though they do come with caveats, e.g. neither study directly mapped ribosomal pausing, and the use of different slippery sites and downstream contexts likely contributed to disparate findings for the optimal distances between the 3′ ends of slippery sites and 5′ ends of frameshift-stimulating oligonucleotides. Although potentially useful therapeutically there are no known natural examples of frameshifting stimulated in this manner, and thus these results do not affect the hypothesis presented here. However, these studies are important in that they raise the possibility for a new role for micro-RNAs in regulating gene expression, and for therapeutic approaches to correcting inborn errors of metabolism due to the presence of frameshift mutations.
